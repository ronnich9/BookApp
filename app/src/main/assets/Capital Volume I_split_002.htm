1867)</span></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The work,
the first volume of which I now submit to the public, forms the continuation of
my </span><i class="calibre4">Zur Kritik der Politischen
Oekonomie</i><span lang="EN-GB"> (<em class="calibre4">A
Contribution to the Criticism of Political Economy</em>) published in 1859. The
long pause between the first part and the continuation is due to an illness of
many years’ duration that again and again interrupted my work. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
substance of that earlier work is summarised in the first three chapters of
this volume. This is done not merely for the sake of connexion and
completeness. The presentation of the subject matter is improved. As far as
circumstances in any way permit, many points only hinted at in the earlier book
are here worked out more fully, whilst, conversely, points worked out fully
there are only touched upon in this volume. The sections on the history of the
theories of value and of money are now, of course, left out altogether. The
reader of the earlier work will find, however, in the notes to the first
chapter additional sources of reference relative to the history of those
theories. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="1b"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Every
beginning is difficult, holds in all sciences. To understand the first chapter,
especially the section that contains the analysis of commodities, will,
therefore, present the greatest difficulty. That which concerns more especially
the analysis of the substance of value and the magnitude of value, I have, as
much as it was possible, popularised.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn1" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a>
The value-form, whose fully developed shape is the money-form, is very
elementary and simple. Nevertheless, the human mind has for more than 2,000
years sought in vain to get to the bottom of it all, whilst on the other hand,
to the successful analysis of much more composite and complex forms, there has
been at least an approximation. Why? Because the body, as an organic whole, is
more easy of study than are the cells of that body. In the analysis of economic
forms, moreover, neither microscopes nor chemical reagents are of use. The
force of abstraction must replace both. But in bourgeois society, the
commodity-form of the product of labour – or value-form of the commodity – is
the economic cell-form. To the superficial observer, the analysis of these forms
seems to turn upon minutiae. It does in fact deal with minutiae, but they are
of the same order as those dealt with in microscopic anatomy. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">With the
exception of the section on value-form, therefore, this volume cannot stand
accused on the score of difficulty. I presuppose, of course, a reader who is
willing to learn something new and therefore to think for himself. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
physicist either observes physical phenomena where they occur in their most
typical form and most free from disturbing influence, or, wherever possible, he
makes experiments under conditions that assure the occurrence of the phenomenon
in its normality. In this work I have to examine the capitalist mode of
production, and the conditions of production and exchange corresponding to that
mode. Up to the present time, their classic ground is England. That is the
reason why England is used as the chief illustration in the development of my
theoretical ideas. If, however, the German reader shrugs his shoulders at the
condition of the English industrial and agricultural labourers, or in optimist
fashion comforts himself with the thought that in Germany things are not nearly
so bad; I must plainly tell him, “<i class="calibre4">De te fabula narratur!</i>” <span>[It is of you that the story is told. – Horace]</span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Intrinsically,
it is not a question of the higher or lower degree of development of the social
antagonisms that result from the natural laws of capitalist production. It is a
question of these laws themselves, of these tendencies working with iron
necessity towards inevitable results. The country that is more developed
industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But apart
from this. Where capitalist production is fully naturalised among the Germans
(for instance, in the factories proper) the condition of things is much worse
than in England, because the counterpoise of the Factory Acts is wanting. In
all other spheres, we, like all the rest of Continental Western Europe, suffer
not only from the development of capitalist production, but also from the
incompleteness of that development. Alongside the modern evils, a whole series
of inherited evils oppress us, arising from the passive survival of antiquated
modes of production, with their inevitable train of social and political
anachronisms. We suffer not only from the living, but from the dead. <em class="calibre4">Le
mort saisit le vif!</em> <span>[The dead holds the living in his
grasp. – formula of French common law]</span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The social
statistics of Germany and the rest of Continental Western Europe are, in
comparison with those of England, wretchedly compiled. But they raise the veil
just enough to let us catch a glimpse of the Medusa head behind it. We should
be appalled at the state of things at home, if, as in England, our governments
and parliaments appointed periodically commissions of inquiry into economic
conditions; if these commissions were armed with the same plenary powers to get
at the truth; if it was possible to find for this purpose men as competent, as
free from partisanship and respect of persons as are the English
factory-inspectors, her medical reporters on public health, her commissioners
of inquiry into the exploitation of women and children, into housing and food.
Perseus wore a magic cap down over his eyes and ears as a make-believe that
there are no monsters. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us not
deceive ourselves on this. As in the 18th century, the American war of
independence sounded the tocsin for the European middle class, so that in the
19th century, the American Civil War sounded it for the European working class.
In England the process of social disintegration is palpable. When it has
reached a certain point, it must react on the Continent. There it will take a
form more brutal or more humane, according to the degree of development of the
working class itself. Apart from higher motives, therefore, their own most
important interests dictate to the classes that are for the nonce the ruling
ones, the removal of all legally removable hindrances to the free development
of the working class. For this reason, as well as others, I have given so large
a space in this volume to the history, the details, and the results of English
factory legislation. One nation can and should learn from others. And even when
a society has got upon the right track for the discovery of the natural laws of
its movement – and it is the ultimate aim of this work, to lay bare the
economic law of motion of modern society – it can neither clear by bold leaps,
nor remove by legal enactments, the obstacles offered by the successive phases
of its normal development. But it can shorten and lessen the birth-pangs. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To prevent
possible misunderstanding, a word. I paint the capitalist and the landlord in
no sense <em class="calibre4">couleur de rose</em> <span>[i.e., seen through
rose-tinted glasses]</span>. But here individuals are dealt with only in so far
as they are the personifications of economic categories, embodiments of
particular class-relations and class-interests. My standpoint, from which the
evolution of the economic formation of society is viewed as a process of
natural history, can less than any other make the individual responsible for
relations whose creature he socially remains, however much he may subjectively
raise himself above them. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
domain of Political Economy, free scientific inquiry meets not merely the same
enemies as in all other domains. The peculiar nature of the materials it deals
with, summons as foes into the field of battle the most violent, mean and
malignant passions of the human breast, the Furies of private interest. The
English Established Church, e.g., will more readily pardon an attack on 38 of
its 39 articles than on 1/39 of its income. Now-a-days atheism is <em class="calibre4">culpa
levis</em> <span>[a relatively slight sin, c.f. mortal sin]</span>,
as compared with criticism of existing property relations. Nevertheless, there
is an unmistakable advance. I refer, e.g., to the Blue book published within
the last few weeks: “Correspondence with Her Majesty’s Missions Abroad,
regarding Industrial Questions and Trades’ Unions.” The representatives of the
English Crown in foreign countries there declare in so many words that in
Germany, in France, to be brief, in all the civilised states of the European
Continent, radical change in the existing relations between capital and labour
is as evident and inevitable as in England. At the same time, on the other side
of the Atlantic Ocean, Mr. Wade, vice-president of the United States, declared
in public meetings that, after the abolition of slavery, a radical change of
the relations of capital and of property in land is next upon the order of the
day. These are signs of the times, not to be hidden by purple mantles or black
cassocks. They do not signify that tomorrow a miracle will happen. They show
that, within the ruling classes themselves, a foreboding is dawning, that the
present society is no solid crystal, but an organism capable of change, and is
constantly changing. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The second
volume of this book will treat of the process of the circulation of capital
(Book II.), and of the varied forms assumed by capital in the course of its
development (Book III.), the third and last volume (Book IV.), the history of
the theory. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Every
opinion based on scientific criticism I welcome. As to prejudices of so-called
public opinion, to which I have never made concessions, now as aforetime the
maxim of the great Florentine is mine: </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Segui il tuo
corso, e lascia dir le genti.” <br class="calibre7"/>
