<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I must
start by informing the readers of the first edition about the alterations made
in the second edition. One is struck at once by the clearer arrangement of the
book. Additional notes are everywhere marked as notes to the second edition.
The following are the most important points with regard to the text itself: </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In </span>Chapter
I, Section 1<span lang="EN-GB">, the derivation
of value from an analysis of the equations by which every exchange-value is
expressed has been carried out with greater scientific strictness; likewise the
connexion between the substance of value and the determination of the magnitude
of value by socially necessary labour-time, which was only alluded to in the first
edition, is now expressly emphasised. </span>Chapter I, Section 3<span lang="EN-GB"> (the Form of Value), has been
completely revised, a task which was made necessary by the double exposition in
the first edition, if nothing else. – Let me remark, in passing, that that
double exposition had been occasioned by my friend, Dr. L Kugelmann in Hanover.
I was visiting him in the spring of 1867 when the first proof-sheets arrived
from Hamburg, and he convinced me that most readers needed a supplementary,
more didactic explanation of the form of value. – The last section of the first
chapter, “The Fetishism of Commodities, etc.,” has largely been altered.
Chapter III, Section I (The Measure of Value), has been carefully revised,
because in the first edition this section had been treated negligently, the
reader having been referred to the explanation already given in “Zur Kritik der
Politischen Oekonomie,” Berlin 1859. Chapter VII, particularly Part 2 [Eng.
ed., </span>Chapter IX, Section 2<span lang="EN-GB">], has been re-written to a great extent. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It would be
a waste of time to go into all the partial textual changes, which were often
purely stylistic. They occur throughout the book. Nevertheless I find now, on
revising the French translation appearing in Paris, that several parts of the
German original stand in need of rather thorough remoulding, other parts
require rather heavy stylistic editing, and still others painstaking
elimination of occasional slips. But there was no time for that. For I had been
informed only in the autumn of 1871, when in the midst of other urgent work,
that the book was sold out and that the printing of the second edition was to
begin in January of 1872. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
appreciation which “Das Kapital” rapidly gained in wide circles of the German
working class is the best reward of my labours. Herr Mayer, a Vienna
manufacturer, who in economic matters represents the bourgeois point of view,
in a pamphlet published during the Franco-German War aptly expounded the idea
that the great capacity for theory, which used to be considered a hereditary German
possession, had almost completely disappeared amongst the so-called educated
classes in Germany, but that amongst its working class, on the contrary, that
capacity was celebrating its revival. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To the
present moment Political Economy, in Germany, is a foreign science. Gustav von
Gulich in his “Historical description of Commerce, Industry,” &amp;c., <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn2" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> especially in the two first volumes
published in 1830, has examined at length the historical circumstances that
prevented, in Germany, the development of the capitalist mode of production,
and consequently the development, in that country, of modern bourgeois society.
Thus the soil whence Political Economy springs was wanting. This “science” had
to be imported from England and France as a ready-made article; its German
professors remained schoolboys. The theoretical expression of a foreign reality
was turned, in their hands, into a collection of dogmas, interpreted by them in
terms of the petty trading world around them, and therefore misinterpreted. The
feeling of scientific impotence, a feeling not wholly to be repressed, and the
uneasy consciousness of having to touch a subject in reality foreign to them,
was but imperfectly concealed, either under a parade of literary and historical
erudition, or by an admixture of extraneous material, borrowed from the
so-called “Kameral” sciences, a medley of smatterings, through whose purgatory
the hopeful candidate for the German bureaucracy has to pass. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Since 1848
capitalist production has developed rapidly in Germany, and at the present time
it is in the full bloom of speculation and swindling. But fate is still
unpropitious to our professional economists. At the time when they were able to
deal with Political Economy in a straightforward fashion, modern economic
conditions did not actually exist in Germany. And as soon as these conditions
did come into existence, they did so under circumstances that no longer allowed
of their being really and impartially investigated within the bounds of the
bourgeois horizon. In so far as Political Economy remains within that horizon,
in so far, i.e., as the capitalist regime is looked upon as the absolutely
final form of social production, instead of as a passing historical phase of
its evolution, Political Economy can remain a science only so long as the class
struggle is latent or manifests itself only in isolated and sporadic phenomena.
<a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="2b"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us take
England. Its Political Economy belongs to the period in which the class
struggle was as yet undeveloped. Its last great representative, Ricardo, in the
end, consciously makes the antagonism of class interests, of wages and profits,
of profits and rent, the starting point of his investigations, naively taking
this antagonism for a social law of Nature. But by this start the science of
bourgeois economy had reached the limits beyond which it could not pass.
Already in the lifetime of Ricardo, and in opposition to him, it was met by
criticism, in the person of Sismondi. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn3" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref3"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
succeeding period, from 1820 to 1830, was notable in England for scientific
activity in the domain of Political Economy. It was the time as well of the
vulgarising and extending of Ricardo’s theory, as of the contest of that theory
with the old school. Splendid tournaments were held. What was done then, is
little known to the Continent generally, because the polemic is for the most
part scattered through articles in reviews, occasional literature and
pamphlets. The unprejudiced character of this polemic – although the theory of
Ricardo already serves, in exceptional cases, as a weapon of attack upon
bourgeois economy – is explained by the circumstances of the time. On the one
hand, modern industry itself was only just emerging from the age of childhood,
as is shown by the fact that with the crisis of 1825 it for the first time opens
the periodic cycle of its modern life. On the other hand, the class struggle
between capital and labour is forced into the background, politically by the
discord between the governments and the feudal aristocracy gathered around the
Holy Alliance on the one hand, and the popular masses, led by the bourgeoisie,
on the other; economically by the quarrel between industrial capital and
aristocratic landed property - a quarrel that in France was concealed by the
opposition between small and large landed property, and that in England broke
out openly after the Corn Laws. The literature of Political Economy in England
at this time calls to mind the stormy forward movement in France after Dr.
Quesnay’s death, but only as a Saint Martin’s summer reminds us of spring. With
the year 1830 came the decisive crisis. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In France
and in England the bourgeoisie had conquered political power. Thenceforth, the
class struggle, practically as well as theoretically, took on more and more
outspoken and threatening forms. It sounded the knell of scientific bourgeois
economy. It was thenceforth no longer a question, whether this theorem or that
was true, but whether it was useful to capital or harmful, expedient or
inexpedient, politically dangerous or not. In place of disinterested inquirers,
there were hired prize fighters; in place of genuine scientific research, the
bad conscience and the evil intent of apologetic. Still, even the obtrusive
pamphlets with which the Anti-Corn Law League, led by the manufacturers Cobden
and Bright, deluged the world, have a historic interest, if no scientific one,
on account of their polemic against the landed aristocracy. But since then the
Free Trade legislation, inaugurated by Sir Robert Peel, has deprived vulgar
economy of this its last sting<a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="art">.</a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
Continental revolution of 1848-9 also had its reaction in England. Men who
still claimed some scientific standing and aspired to be something more than
mere sophists and sycophants of the ruling classes tried to harmonise the
Political Economy of capital with the claims, no longer to be ignored, of the
proletariat. Hence a shallow syncretism of which John Stuart Mill is the best
representative. It is a declaration of bankruptcy by bourgeois economy, an
event on which the great Russian scholar and critic, N. Tschernyschewsky, has
thrown the light of a master mind in his “Outlines of Political Economy
according to Mill.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In Germany,
therefore, the capitalist mode of production came to a head, after its
antagonistic character had already, in France and England, shown itself in a
fierce strife of classes. And meanwhile, moreover, the German proletariat had
attained a much more clear class-consciousness than the German bourgeoisie.
Thus, at the very moment when a bourgeois science of Political Economy seemed
at last possible in Germany, it had in reality again become impossible. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Under these
circumstances its professors fell into two groups. The one set, prudent,
practical business folk, flocked to the banner of Bastiat, the most superficial
and therefore the most adequate representative of the apologetic of vulgar
economy; the other, proud of the professorial dignity of their science,
followed John Stuart Mill in his attempt to reconcile irreconcilables. Just as
in the classical time of bourgeois economy, so also in the time of its decline,
the Germans remained mere schoolboys, imitators and followers, petty retailers
and hawkers in the service of the great foreign wholesale concern. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
peculiar historical development of German society therefore forbids, in that
country, all original work in bourgeois economy; but not the criticism of that
economy. So far as such criticism represents a class, it can only represent the
class whose vocation in history is the overthrow of the capitalist mode of
production and the final abolition of all classes – the proletariat. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="3b"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The learned
and unlearned spokesmen of the German bourgeoisie tried at first to kill “Das
Kapital” by silence, as they had managed to do with my earlier writings. As
soon as they found that these tactics no longer fitted in with the conditions
of the time, they wrote, under pretence of criticising my book, prescriptions
“for the tranquillisation of the bourgeois mind.” But they found in the
workers’ press – see, e.g., Joseph Dietzgen’s articles in the<span>  </span>– antagonists stronger than themselves, to
whom (down to this very day) they owe a reply. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn4" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref4"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An
excellent Russian translation of “Das Kapital” appeared in the spring of 1872.
The edition of 3,000 copies is already nearly exhausted. As early as 1871, N.
Sieber, Professor of Political Economy in the University of Kiev, in his work
“David Ricardo’s Theory of Value and of Capital,” referred to my theory of
value, of money and of capital, as in its fundamentals a necessary sequel to
the teaching of Smith and Ricardo. That which astonishes the Western European
in the reading of this excellent work, is the author’s consistent and firm
grasp of the purely theoretical position.<span> 
</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">That the
method employed in “Das Kapital” has been little understood, is shown by the
various conceptions, contradictory one to another, that have been formed of it.
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thus the <em class="calibre4">Paris
Revue Positiviste</em> reproaches me in that, on the one hand, I treat
economics metaphysically, and on the other hand – imagine! – confine myself to
the mere critical analysis of actual facts, instead of writing receipts<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn5" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref5"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> (Comtist ones?) for the cook-shops of the
future. In answer to the reproach in re metaphysics, Professor Sieber has it:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“In so far as
it deals with actual theory, the method of Marx is the deductive method of the
whole English school, a school whose failings and virtues are common to the
best theoretic economists.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">M. Block –
“Les Théoriciens du Socialisme en Allemagne. Extrait du Journal des
Economistes, Juillet et Août 1872” – makes the discovery that my method is
analytic and says: “Par cet ouvrage M. Marx se classe parmi les esprits
analytiques les plus eminents.” German reviews, of course, shriek out at
“Hegelian sophistics.” The <i class="calibre4">European Messenger</i> of St. Petersburg in an
article dealing exclusively with the method of “Das Kapital” (May number, 1872,
pp. 427-436), finds my method of inquiry severely realistic, but my method of
presentation, unfortunately, German-dialectical. It says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“At first
sight, if the judgment is based on the external form of the presentation of the
subject, Marx is the most ideal of ideal philosophers, always in the German,
i.e., the bad sense of the word. But in point of fact he is infinitely more
realistic than all his forerunners in the work of economic criticism. He can in
no sense be called an idealist.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I cannot
answer the writer better than by aid of a few extracts from his own criticism,
which may interest some of my readers to whom the Russian original is
inaccessible.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After a
quotation from the preface to my “Criticism of Political Economy,” Berlin,
1859, pp. IV-VII, where I discuss the materialistic basis of my method, the
writer goes on: </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The one
thing which is of moment to Marx, is to find the law of the phenomena with
whose investigation he is concerned; and not only is that law of moment to him,
which governs these phenomena, in so far as they have a definite form and
mutual connexion within a given historical period. Of still greater moment to
him is the law of their variation, of their development, i.e., of their
transition from one form into another, from one series of connexions into a
different one. This law once discovered, he investigates in detail the effects
in which it manifests itself in social life. Consequently, Marx only troubles
himself about one thing: to show, by rigid scientific investigation, the
necessity of successive determinate orders of social conditions, and to
establish, as impartially as possible, the facts that serve him for fundamental
starting-points. For this it is quite enough, if he proves, at the same time,
both the necessity of the present order of things, and the necessity of another
order into which the first must inevitably pass over; and this all the same,
whether men believe or do not believe it, whether they are conscious or unconscious
of it. Marx treats the social movement as a process of natural history,
governed by laws not only independent of human will, consciousness and
intelligence, but rather, on the contrary, determining that will, consciousness
and intelligence. ... If in the history of civilisation the conscious element
plays a part so subordinate, then it is self-evident that a critical inquiry
whose subject-matter is civilisation, can, less than anything else, have for
its basis any form of, or any result of, consciousness. That is to say, that
not the idea, but the material phenomenon alone can serve as its
starting-point. Such an inquiry will confine itself to the confrontation and
the comparison of a fact, not with ideas, but with another fact. For this
inquiry, the one thing of moment is, that both facts be investigated as
accurately as possible, and that they actually form, each with respect to the
other, different momenta of an evolution; but most important of all is the
rigid analysis of the series of successions, of the sequences and
concatenations in which the different stages of such an evolution present
themselves. But it will be said, the general laws of economic life are one and
the same, no matter whether they are applied to the present or the past. This Marx
directly denies. According to him, such abstract laws do not exist. On the
contrary, in his opinion every historical period has laws of its own. ... As
soon as society has outlived a given period of development, and is passing over
from one given stage to another, it begins to be subject also to other laws. In
a word, economic life offers us a phenomenon analogous to the history of
evolution in other branches of biology. The old economists misunderstood the
nature of economic laws when they likened them to the laws of physics and
chemistry. A more thorough analysis of phenomena shows that social organisms
differ among themselves as fundamentally as plants or animals. Nay, one and the
same phenomenon falls under quite different laws in consequence of the
different structure of those organisms as a whole, of the variations of their
individual organs, of the different conditions in which those organs function,
&amp;c. Marx, e.g., denies that the law of population is the same at all times
and in all places. He asserts, on the contrary, that every stage of development
has its own law of population. ... With the varying degree of development of
productive power, social conditions and the laws governing them vary too.
Whilst Marx sets himself the task of following and explaining from this point
of view the economic system established by the sway of capital, he is only
formulating, in a strictly scientific manner, the aim that every accurate
investigation into economic life must have. The scientific value of such an inquiry
lies in the disclosing of the special laws that regulate the origin, existence,
development, death of a given social organism and its replacement by another
and higher one. And it is this value that, in point of fact, Marx’s book has.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Whilst the
writer pictures what he takes to be actually my method, in this striking and
[as far as concerns my own application of it] generous way, what else is he
picturing but the dialectic method? </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Of course
the method of presentation must differ in form from that of inquiry. The latter
has to appropriate the material in detail, to analyse its different forms of
development, to trace out their inner connexion. Only after this work is done,
can the actual movement be adequately described. If this is done successfully,
if the life of the subject-matter is ideally reflected as in a mirror, then it
may appear as if we had before us a mere a priori construction. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">My
dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct
opposite. To Hegel, the life process of the human brain, i.e., the process of
thinking, which, under the name of “the Idea,” he even transforms into an
independent subject, is the demiurgos of the real world, and the real world is
only the external, phenomenal form of “the Idea.” With me, on the contrary, the
ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and
translated into forms of thought. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
mystifying side of Hegelian dialectic I criticised nearly thirty years ago, at
a time when it was still the fashion. But just as I was working at the first
volume of “Das Kapital,” it was the good pleasure of the peevish, arrogant,
mediocre </span><span class="greek"><span lang="EN-GB">Epigonoi</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> <span>[Epigones – Büchner, Dühring and others]</span> who now talk
large in cultured Germany, to treat Hegel in same way as the brave Moses
Mendelssohn in Lessing’s time treated Spinoza, i.e., as a “dead dog.” I
therefore openly avowed myself the pupil of that mighty thinker, and even here
and there, in the chapter on the theory of value, coquetted with the modes of
expression peculiar to him. The mystification which dialectic suffers in
Hegel’s hands, by no means prevents him from being the first to present its
general form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner. With him it is
standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would
discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In its
mystified form, dialectic became the fashion in Germany, because it seemed to
transfigure and to glorify the existing state of things. In its rational form
it is a scandal and abomination to bourgeoisdom and its doctrinaire professors,
because it includes in its comprehension and affirmative recognition of the
existing state of things, at the same time also, the recognition of the
