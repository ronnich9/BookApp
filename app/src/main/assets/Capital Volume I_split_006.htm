<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Marx was
not destined to get this, the third, edition ready for press himself. The
powerful thinker, to whose greatness even his opponents now make obeisance,
died on March 14, 1883.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Upon me who
in Marx lost the best, the truest friend I had – and had for forty years – the
friend to whom I am more indebted than can be expressed in words – upon me now
devolved the duty of attending to the publication of this third edition, as
well as of the second volume, which Marx had left behind in manuscript. I must
now account here to the reader for the way in which I discharged the first part
of my duty.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was
Marx's original intention to re-write a great part of the text of Volume I, to
formulate many theoretical points more exactly, insert new ones and bring
historical and statistical materials up to date. But his ailing condition and
the urgent need to do the final editing of Volume II induced him to give up this
scheme. Only the most necessary alterations were to be made, only the
insertions which the French edition (“Le Capital.” Par Karl Marx. Paris,
Lachâtre 1873) already contained, were to be put in.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Among the
books left by Marx there was a German copy which he himself had corrected here
and there and provided with references to the French edition; also a French
copy in which he had indicated the exact passages to be used. These alterations
and additions are confined, with few exceptions, to the last [Engl. ed.: second
last] part of the book: “The Accumulation of Capital.” Here the previous text
followed the original draft more closely than elsewhere, while the preceding
sections had been gone over more thoroughly. The style was therefore more
vivacious, more of a single cast, but also more careless, studded with
Anglicisms and in parts unclear; there were gaps here and there in the
presentation of arguments, some important particulars being merely alluded to.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">With regard
to the style, Marx had himself thoroughly revised several sub-sections and
thereby had indicated to me here, as well as in numerous oral suggestions, the
length to which I could go in eliminating English technical terms and other
Anglicisms. Marx would in any event have gone over the additions and
supplemental texts and have replaced the smooth French with his own terse
German; I had to be satisfied, when transferring them, with bringing them into
maximum harmony with the original text.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thus not a
single word was changed in this third edition without my firm conviction that
the author would have altered it himself. It would never occur to me to
introduce into “Das Kapital” the current jargon in which German economists are
wont to express themselves – that gibberish in which, for instance, one who for
cash has others give him their labour is called a labour-giver (Arbeitgeber)
and one whose labour is taken away from him for wages is called a labour-taker
(Arbeitnehmer). In French, too, the word “travail” is used in every-day life in
the sense of “occupation.” But the French would rightly consider any economist
crazy should he call the capitalist a donneur de travail (a labour-giver) or
the worker a receveur de travail (a labour-taker).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Nor have I
taken the liberty to convert the English coins and moneys, measures and weights
used throughout the text to their new-German equivalents. When the first
edition appeared there were as many kinds of measures and weights in Germany as
there are days in the year. Besides there were two kinds of marks (the Reichsmark
existed at the time only in the imagination of Soetbeer, who had invented it in
the late thirties), two kinds of gulden and at least three kinds of taler,
including one called neues Zweidrittel. In the natural sciences the metric
system prevailed, in the world market – English measures and weights. Under
such circumstances English units of measure were quite natural for a book which
had to take its factual proofs almost exclusively from British industrial
relations. The last-named reason is decisive even to-day, especially because
the corresponding relations in the world market have hardly changed and English
weights and measures almost completely control precisely the key industries,
iron and cotton.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In
conclusion a few words on Marx's art of quotation, which is so little
understood. When they are pure statements of fact or descriptions, the
quotations, from the English Blue books, for example, serve of course as simple
documentary proof. But this is not so when the theoretical views of other economists
are cited. Here the quotation is intended merely to state where, when and by
whom an economic idea conceived in the course of development was first clearly
enunciated. Here the only consideration is that the economic conception in
question must be of some significance to the history of science, that it is the
more or less adequate theoretical expression of the economic situation of its
time. But whether this conception still possesses any absolute or relative
validity from the standpoint of the author or whether it already has become
wholly past history is quite immaterial. Hence these quotations are only a
running commentary to the text, a commentary borrowed from the history of
economic science, and establish the dates and originators of certain of the
more important advances in economic theory. And that was a very necessary thing
in a science whose historians have so far distinguished themselves only by
tendentious ignorance characteristic of careerists. It will now be
understandable why Marx, in consonance with the Afterword to the second
edition, only in very exceptional cases had occasion to quote German
economists.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There is
hope that the second volume will appear in the course of 1884.</span></p>
