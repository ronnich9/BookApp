<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
publication of an English version of “Das Kapital” needs no apology. On the
contrary, an explanation might be expected why this English version has been
delayed until now, seeing that for some years past the theories advocated in
this book have been constantly referred to, attacked and defended, interpreted
and misinterpreted, in the periodical press and the current literature of both
England and America.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When, soon
after the author's death in 1883, it became evident that an English edition of
the work was really required, Mr. Samuel Moore, for many years a friend of Marx
and of the present writer, and than whom, perhaps, no one is more conversant
with the book itself, consented to undertake the translation which the literary
executors of Marx were anxious to lay before the public. It was understood that
I should compare the MS. with the original work, and suggest such alterations
as I might deem advisable. When, by and by, it was found that Mr. Moore's
professional occupations prevented him from finishing the translation as
quickly as we all desired, we gladly accepted Dr. Aveling's offer to undertake
a portion of the work; at the same time Mrs. Aveling, Marx's youngest daughter,
offered to check the quotations and to restore the original text of the
numerous passages taken from English authors and Blue books and translated by
Marx into German. This has been done throughout, with but a few unavoidable
exceptions.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
following portions of the book have been translated by Dr. Aveling: (I)
Chapters X. (The Working day), and XI. (Rate and Mass of Surplus-Value); (2)
Part VI. (Wages, comprising Chapters XIX. to XXII.); (3) from Chapter XXIV.,
Section 4 (Circumstances that &amp;c.) to the end of the book, comprising the
latter part of Chapter XXIV.,. Chapter XXV., and the whole of Part VIII.
(Chapters XXVI. to XXXIII); (4) the two Author's prefaces. All the rest of the
book has been done by Mr. Moore. While, thus, each of the translators is
responsible for his share of the work only, I bear a joint responsibility for
the whole.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The third
German edition, which has been made the basis of our work throughout, was
prepared by me, in 1883, with the assistance of notes left by the author,
indicating the passages of the second edition to be replaced by designated
passages, from the French text published in 1873.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn6" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref6"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a>
The alterations thus effected in the text of the second edition generally
coincided with changes prescribed by Marx in a set of MS. instructions for an
English translation that was planned, about ten years ago, in America, but
abandoned chiefly for want of a fit and proper translator. This MS. was placed
at our disposal by our old friend Mr. F. A. Sorge of Hoboken N. J. It
designates some further interpolations from the French edition; but, being so
many years older than the final instructions for the third edition, I did not
consider myself at liberty to make use of it otherwise than sparingly, and
chiefly in cases where it helped us over difficulties. In the same way, the
French text has been referred to in most of the difficult passages, as an
indicator of what the author himself was prepared to sacrifice wherever
something of the full import of the original had to be sacrificed in the
rendering.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There is,
however, one difficulty we could not spare the reader: the use of certain terms
in a sense different from what they have, not only in common life, but in
ordinary Political Economy. But this was unavoidable. Every new aspect of a
science involves a revolution in the technical terms of that science. This is
best shown by chemistry, where the whole of the terminology is radically
changed about once in twenty years, and where you will hardly find a single
organic compound that has not gone through a whole series of different names.
Political Economy has generally been content to take, just as they were, the
terms of commercial and industrial life, and to operate with them, entirely
failing to see that by so doing, it confined itself within the narrow circle of
ideas expressed by those terms. Thus, though perfectly aware that both profits
and rent are but sub-divisions, fragments of that unpaid part of the product
which the labourer has to supply to his employer (its first appropriator,
though not its ultimate exclusive owner), yet even classical Political Economy
never went beyond the received notions of profits and rents, never examined
this unpaid part of the product (called by Marx surplus-product) in its
integrity as a whole, and therefore never arrived at a clear comprehension,
either of its origin and nature, or of the laws that regulate the subsequent
distribution of its value. Similarly all industry, not agricultural or
handicraft, is indiscriminately comprised in the term of manufacture, and
thereby the distinction is obliterated between two great and essentially
different periods of economic history: the period of manufacture proper, based
on the division of manual labour, and the period of modern industry based on
machinery. It is, however, self- evident that a theory which views modern capitalist
production as a mere passing stage in the economic history of mankind, must
make use of terms different from those habitual to writers who look upon that
form of production as imperishable and final.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A word
respecting the author's method of quoting may not be out of place. In the
majority of cases, the quotations serve, in the usual way, as documentary
evidence in support of assertions made in the text. But in many instances,
passages from economic writers are quoted in order to indicate when, where, and
by whom a certain proposition was for the first time clearly enunciated. This
is done in cases where the proposition quoted is of importance as being a more
or less adequate expression of the conditions of social production and exchange
prevalent at the time, and quite irrespective of Marx's recognition, or
otherwise, of its general validity. These quotations, therefore, supplement the
text by a running commentary taken from the history of the science.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Our
translation comprises the first book of the work only. But this first book is
in a great measure a whole in itself, and has for twenty years ranked as an
independent work. The second book, edited in German by me, in 1885, is
decidedly incomplete without the third, which cannot be published before the
end of 1887. When Book III. has been brought out in the original German, it
will then be soon enough to think about preparing an English edition of both.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“Das
Kapital” is often called, on the Continent, “the Bible of the working class.”
That the conclusions arrived at in this work are daily more and more becoming
the fundamental principles of the great working- class movement, not only in
Germany and Switzerland, but in France, in Holland and Belgium, in America, and
even in Italy and Spain, that everywhere the working class more and more
recognises, in these conclusions, the most adequate expression of its condition
and of its aspirations, nobody acquainted with that movement will deny. And in
England, too, the theories of Marx, even at this moment, exercise a powerful
influence upon the socialist movement which is spreading in the ranks of
“cultured” people no less than in those of the working class. But that is not
all. The time is rapidly approaching when a thorough examination of England's
economic position will impose itself as an irresistible national necessity. The
working of the industrial system of this country, impossible without a constant
and rapid extension of production, and therefore of markets, is coming to a
dead stop.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Free Trade
has exhausted its resources; even Manchester doubts this its quondam economic
gospel.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn7" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref7"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a><span> 
</span>Foreign industry, rapidly developing, stares English production in the
face everywhere, not only in protected, but also in neutral markets, and even
on this side of the Channel. While the productive power increases in a
geometric, the extension of markets proceeds at best in an arithmetic ratio.
The decennial cycle of stagnation, prosperity, over-production and crisis, ever
recurrent from 1825 to 1867, seems indeed to have run its course; but only to
land us in the slough of despond of a permanent and chronic depression. The
sighed for period of prosperity will not come; as often as we seem to perceive
its heralding symptoms, so often do they again vanish into air. Meanwhile, each
succeeding winter brings up afresh the great question, “what to do with the
unemployed"; but while the number of the unemployed keeps swelling from
year to year, there is nobody to answer that question; and we can almost
calculate the moment when the unemployed losing patience will take their own
fate into their own hands. Surely, at such a moment, the voice ought to be
heard of a man whose whole theory is the result of a lifelong study of the
economic history and condition of England, and whom that study led to the
conclusion that, at least in Europe, England is the only country where the
inevitable social revolution might be effected entirely by peaceful and legal
means. He certainly never forgot to add that he hardly expected the English
ruling classes to submit, without a “pro-slavery rebellion,” to this peaceful
and legal revolution.</span></p>
