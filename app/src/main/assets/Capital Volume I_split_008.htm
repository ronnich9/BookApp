(Engels, 1890)</span></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The fourth
edition required that I should establish in final form, as nearly as possible,
both text and footnotes. The following brief explanation will show how I have
fulfilled this task.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After again
comparing the French edition and Marx’s manuscript remarks I have made some
further additions to the German text from that translation. They will be found
on p. 80 (3rd edition, p. 88) [present edition, pp. 117-18], pp. 458-60 (3rd
edition, pp. 509-10) [present edition, pp. 462-65],<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn8" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref8"><span class="EndnoteCharacters"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="EndnoteCharacters"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre16">[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span>  </span>pp. 547-51 (3rd edition, p. 600) [present
edition, pp. 548-51], pp. 591-93 (3rd edition, p. 644) [present edition,
587-89] and p. 596 (3rd edition, p. 648) [present edition, p. 591] in Note 1. I
have also followed the example of the French and English editions by putting
the long footnote on the miners into the text (3rd edition, pp. 509-15; 4th
edition, pp. 461-67) [present edition, pp. 465-71]. Other small alterations are
of a purely technical nature.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Further, I
have added a few more explanatory notes, especially where changed historical
conditions seemed to demand this. All these additional notes are enclosed in
square brackets and marked either with my initials or “D. H.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn9" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref9"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Meanwhile a
complete revision of the numerous quotations had been made necessary by the
publication of the English edition. For this edition Marx’s youngest daughter,
Eleanor, undertook to compare all the quotations with their originals, so that
those taken from English sources, which constitute the vast majority, are given
there not as re-translations from the German but in the original English form.
In preparing the fourth edition it was therefore incumbent upon me to consult
this text. The comparison revealed various small inaccuracies. Page numbers
wrongly indicated, due partly to mistakes in copying from notebooks, and partly
to the accumulated misprints of three editions; misplaced quotation or omission
marks, which cannot be avoided when a mass of quotations is copied from
note-book extracts; here and there some rather unhappy translation of a word;
particular passages quoted from the old Paris notebooks of 1843-45, when Marx
did not know English and was reading English economists in French translations,
so that the double translation yielded a slightly different shade of meaning,
e.g., in the case of Steuart, Ure, etc., where the English text had now to be
used – and other similar instances of trifling inaccuracy or negligence. But
anyone who compares the fourth edition with the previous ones can convince
himself that all this laborious process of emendation has not produced the
smallest change in the book worth speaking of. There was only one quotation
which could not be traced – the one from Richard Jones (4th edition, p. 562,
note 47). Marx probably slipped up when writing down the title of the book.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn10" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref10"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a> All the other quotations retain their
cogency in full, or have enhanced it due to their present exact form.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Here,
however, I am obliged to revert to an old story.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I know of
only one case in which the accuracy of a quotation given by Marx has been
called in question. But as the issue dragged beyond his lifetime I cannot well
ignore it here.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On March 7,
1872, there appeared in the Berlin Concordia, organ of the German
Manufacturers’ Association, an anonymous article entitled: “How Karl Marx
Quotes.” It was here asserted, with an effervescence of moral indignation and
unparliamentary language, that the quotation from Gladstone’s Budget Speech of
April 16, 1863 (in the Inaugural Address of the International Workingmen’s
Association, 1864, and repeated in “Capital,” Vol. I, p. 617, 4th edition; p.
671, 3rd edition) [present edition, p. 610], had been falsified; that not a
single word of the sentence: “this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and
power ... is ... entirely confined to classes of property” was to be found in
the (semi-official) stenographic report in Hansard. “But this sentence is
nowhere to be found in Gladstone’s speech. Exactly the opposite is stated
there.” (In bold type): “This sentence, both in form and substance, is a lie
inserted by Marx."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Marx, to
whom the number of Concordia was sent the following May, answered the anonymous
author in the <i class="calibre4">Volksstaat</i> of June 1st.
As he could not recall which newspaper report he had used for the quotation, he
limited himself to citing, first the equivalent quotation from two English
publications, and then the report in The Times, according to which Gladstone
says:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“That is
the state of the case as regards the wealth of this country. I must say for
one, I should look almost with apprehension and with pain upon this
intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power, if it were my belief that it was
confined to classes who are in easy circumstances. This takes no cognisance at
all of the condition of the labouring population. The augmentation I have
described and which is founded, I think, upon accurate returns, is an
augmentation entirely confined to classes possessed of property.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thus
Gladstone says here that he would be sorry if it were so, but it is so: this
intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined to classes
of property. And as to the semi-official Hansard, Marx goes on to say: “In the
version which he afterwards manipulated [zurechtgestümpert], Mr. Gladstone was
astute enough to obliterate [wegzupfuschen] this passage, which, coming from an
English Chancellor of the Exchequer, was certainly compromising. This, by the
way, is a traditional usage in the English parliament and not an invention
gotten up by little Lasker against Bebel.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
anonymous writer gets angrier and angrier. In his answer in Concordia, July
4th, he sweeps aside second-hand sources and demurely suggests that it is the
“custom” to quote parliamentary speeches from the stenographic report; adding,
however, that The Times report (which includes the “falsified” sentence) and
the Hansard report (which omits it) are “substantially in complete agreement,”
while The Times report likewise contains “the exact opposite to that notorious
passage in the Inaugural Address.” This fellow carefully conceals the fact that
The Times report explicitly includes that self-same “notorious passage,”
alongside of its alleged “opposite.” Despite all this, however, the anonymous
one feels that he is stuck fast and that only some new dodge can save him.
Thus, whilst his article bristles, as we have just shown, with “impudent
mendacity” and is interlarded with such edifying terms of abuse as “bad faith,”
“dishonesty,” “lying allegation,” “that spurious quotation,” “impudent
mendacity,” “a quotation entirely falsified,” “this falsification,” “simply
infamous,” etc., he finds it necessary to divert the issue to another domain
and therefore promises “to explain in a second article the meaning which we
(the non-mendacious anonymous one) attribute to the content of Gladstone’s
words.” As if his particular opinion, of no decisive value as it is, had
anything whatever to do with the matter. This second article was printed in Concordia
on July 11th.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Marx
replied again in the <i class="calibre4">Volksstaat</i> of
August 7th now giving also the reports of the passage in question from the
Morning Star and the Morning Advertiser of April 17, 1863. According to both
reports Gladstone said that he would look with apprehension, etc., upon this
intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power if he believed it to be confined
to “classes in easy circumstances.” But this augmentation was in fact “entirely
confined to classes possessed of property.” So these reports too reproduced
word for word the sentence alleged to have been “lyingly inserted.” Marx
further established once more, by a comparison of The Times and the Hansard
texts, that this sentence, which three newspaper reports of identical content,
appearing independently of one another the next morning, proved to have been
really uttered, was missing from the Hansard report, revised according to the
familiar “custom,” and that Gladstone, to use Marx’s words, “had afterwards
conjured it away.” In conclusion Marx stated that he had no time for further
intercourse with the anonymous one. The latter also seems to have had enough,
at any rate Marx received no further issues of Concordia.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">With this
the matter appeared to be dead and buried. True, once or twice later on there
reached us, from persons in touch with the University of Cambridge, mysterious
rumours of an unspeakable literary crime which Marx was supposed to have
committed in “Capital,” but despite all investigation nothing more definite
could be learned. Then, on November 29, 1883, eight months after Marx’s death,
there appeared in The Times a letter headed Trinity College, Cambridge, and
signed Sedley Taylor, in which this little man, who dabbles in the mildest sort
of co-operative affairs, seizing upon some chance pretext or other, at last
enlightened us, not only concerning those vague Cambridge rumours, but also the
anonymous one in Concordia.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“What
appears extremely singular,” says the little man from Trinity College, “is that
it was reserved for Professor Brentano (then of the University of Breslau, now
of that of Strassburg) to expose... the bad faith which had manifestly dictated
the citation made from Mr. Gladstone’s speech in the [Inaugural] Address. Herr
Karl Marx, who ... attempted to defend the citation, had the hardihood, in the
deadly shifts to which Brentano’s masterly conduct of the attack speedily
reduced him, to assert that Mr. Gladstone had ‘manipulated’ the report of his
speech in The Times of April 17, 1863, before it appeared in Hansard, in order
to ‘obliterate’ a passage which ‘was certainly compromising’ for an English
Chancellor of the Exchequer. On Brentano’s showing, by a detailed comparison of
texts, that the reports of The Times and of Hansard agreed in utterly excluding
the meaning which craftily isolated quotation had put upon Mr. Gladstone’s
words, Marx withdrew from further controversy under the plea of ‘want of
time.’”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So that was
at the bottom of the whole business! And thus was the anonymous campaign of
Herr Brentano in Concordia gloriously reflected in the productively
co-operating imagination of Cambridge. Thus he stood, sword in hand, and thus
he battled, in his “masterly conduct of the attack,” this St. George of the
German Manufacturers’ Association, whilst the infernal dragon Marx, “in deadly
shifts,” “speedily” breathed his last at his feet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">All this
Ariostian battle scene, however, only serves to conceal the dodges of our St.
George. Here there is no longer talk of “lying insertion” or “falsification,”
but of “craftily isolated quotation.” The whole issue was shifted, and St.
George and his Cambridge squire very well knew why.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Eleanor
Marx replied in the monthly journal To-day (February 1884), as The Times
refused to publish her letter. She once more focussed the debate on the sole
question at issue: had Marx “lyingly inserted” that sentence or not? To this
Mr. Sedley Taylor answered that “the question whether a particular sentence did
or did not occur in Mr. Gladstone’s speech” had been, in his opinion, “of very
subordinate importance” in the Brentano-Marx controversy, “compared to the
issue whether the quotation in dispute was made with the intention of
conveying, or of perverting Mr. Gladstone’s meaning.” He then admits that The
Times report contains “a verbal contrariety"; but, if the context is
rightly interpreted, i.e., in the Gladstonian Liberal sense, it shows what Mr.
Gladstone meant to say. (To-day, March, 1884.) The most comic point here is
that our little Cambridge man now insists upon quoting the speech not from Hansard,
as, according to the anonymous Brentano, it is “customary” to do, but from The
Times report, which the same Brentano had characterised as “necessarily
bungling.” Naturally so, for in Hansard the vexatious sentence is missing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Eleanor
Marx had no difficulty (in the same issue of To-day) in dissolving all this
argumentation into thin air. Either Mr. Taylor had read the controversy of
1872, in which case he was now making not only “lying insertions” but also
“lying” suppressions; or he had not read it and ought to remain silent. In
either case it was certain that he did not dare to maintain for a moment the
accusation of his friend Brentano that Marx had made a “lying” addition. On the
contrary, Marx, it now seems, had not lyingly added but suppressed an important
sentence. But this same sentence is quoted on page 5 of the Inaugural Address,
a few lines before the alleged “lying insertion.” And as to the “contrariety”
in Gladstone’s speech, is it not Marx himself, who in “Capital,” p. 618 (3rd
edition, p. 672), note 105 [present edition, p. 611, Note 1], refers to “the
continual crying contradictions in Gladstone’s Budget speeches of 1863 and
1864"? Only he does not presume à la Mr. Sedley Taylor to resolve them
into complacent Liberal sentiments. Eleanor Marx, in concluding her reply,
finally sums up as follows:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“Marx has
not suppressed anything worth quoting, neither has he ‘lyingly’ added anything.
But he has restored, rescued from oblivion, a particular sentence of one of Mr.
Gladstone’s speeches, a sentence which had indubitably been pronounced, but
which somehow or other had found its way – out of Hansard.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">With that
Mr. Sedley Taylor too had had enough, and the result of this whole professorial
cobweb, spun out over two decades and two great countries, is that nobody has
since dared to cast any other aspersion upon Marx’s literary honesty; whilst
Mr. Sedley Taylor, no doubt, will hereafter put as little confidence in the
literary war bulletins of Herr Brentano as Herr Brentano will in the papal
infallibility of Hansard.</span></p>
