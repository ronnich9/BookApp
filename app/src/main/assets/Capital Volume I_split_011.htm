<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is plain
that commodities cannot go to market and make exchanges of their own account.
We must, therefore, have recourse to their guardians, who are also their
owners. Commodities are things, and therefore without power of resistance
against man. If they are wanting in docility he can use force; in other words,
he can take possession of them.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn49" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref49"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> In order
that these objects may enter into relation with each other as commodities,
their guardians must place themselves in relation to one another, as persons
whose will resides in those objects, and must behave in such a way that each
does not appropriate the commodity of the other, and part with his own, except
by means of an act done by mutual consent. They must therefore, mutually
recognise in each other the rights of private proprietors. This juridical
relation, which thus expresses itself in a contract, whether such contract be
part of a developed legal system or not, is a relation between two wills, and
is but the reflex of the real economic relation between the two. It is this
economic relation that determines the subject-matter comprised in each such
juridical act.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn50" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref50"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The persons
exist for one another merely as representatives of, and, therefore. as owners
of, commodities. In the course of our investigation we shall find, in general,
that the characters who appear on the economic stage are but the
personifications of the economic relations that exist between them. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">What
chiefly distinguishes a commodity from its owner is the fact, that it looks
upon every other commodity as but the form of appearance of its own value. A
born leveller and a cynic, it is always ready to exchange not only soul, but
body, with any and every other commodity, be the same more repulsive than
Maritornes herself. The owner makes up for this lack in the commodity of a
sense of the concrete, by his own five and more senses. His commodity possesses
for himself no immediate use-value. Otherwise, he would not bring it to the market.
It has use-value for others; but for himself its only direct use-value is that
of being a depository of exchange-value, and, consequently, a means of
exchange. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn51" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref51"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a><span>Â  </span>Therefore, he makes up his mind to part with
it for commodities whose value in use is of service to him. All commodities are
non-use-values for their owners, and use-values for their non-owners.
Consequently, they must all change hands. But this change of hands is what
constitutes their exchange, and the latter puts them in relation with each
other as values, and realises them as values. Hence commodities must be
realised as values before they can be realised as use-values. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the
other hand, they must show that they are use-values before they can be realised
as values. For the labour spent upon them counts effectively, only in so far as
it is spent in a form that is useful for others. Whether that labour is useful
for others, and its product consequently capable of satisfying the wants of
others, can be proved only by the act of exchange. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Every owner
of a commodity wishes to part with it in exchange only for those commodities
whose use-value satisfies some want of his. Looked at in this way, exchange is
for him simply a private transaction. On the other hand, he desires to realise
the value of his commodity, to convert it into any other suitable commodity of
equal value, irrespective of whether his own commodity has or has not any
use-value for the owner of the other. From this point of view, exchange is for
him a social transaction of a general character. But one and the same set of
transactions cannot be simultaneously for all owners of commodities both
exclusively private and exclusively social and general. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us look
at the matter a little closer. To the owner of a commodity, every other commodity
is, in regard to his own, a particular equivalent, and consequently his own
commodity is the universal equivalent for all the others. But since this
applies to every owner, there is, in fact, no commodity acting as universal
equivalent, and the relative value of commodities possesses no general form
under which they can be equated as values and have the magnitude of their
values compared. So far, therefore, they do not confront each other as
commodities, but only as products or use-values. In their difficulties our
commodity owners think like Faust: âIm Anfang war die Tat.â <span>[âIn the beginning was the deed.â â Goethe, <i class="calibre4">Faust</i>.]</span>
They therefore acted and transacted before they thought. Instinctively they
conform to the laws imposed by the nature of commodities. They cannot bring
their commodities into relation as values, and therefore as commodities, except
by comparing them with some one other commodity as the universal equivalent.
That we saw from the analysis of a commodity. But a particular commodity cannot
become the universal equivalent except by a social act. The social action
therefore of all other commodities, sets apart the particular commodity in
which they all represent their values. Thereby the bodily form of this
commodity becomes the form of the socially recognised universal equivalent. To
be the universal equivalent, becomes, by this social process, the specific
function of the commodity thus excluded by the rest. Thus it becomes â money.
âIlli unum consilium habent et virtutem et potestatem suam bestiae tradunt. Et
ne quis possit emere aut vendere, nisi qui habet characterem aut nomen bestiae
aut numerum nominis ejus.â <span>[âThese have one mind, and shall
give their power and strength unto the beast.â Revelations, 17:13; âAnd that no
man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or
the number of his name.â Revelations, 13:17.]</span> (<em class="calibre4">Apocalypse</em>.) </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Money is a
crystal formed of necessity in the course of the exchanges, whereby different
products of labour are practically equated to one another and thus by practice
converted into commodities. The historical progress and extension of exchanges
develops the contrast, latent in commodities, between use-value and value. The
necessity for giving an external expression to this contrast for the purposes
of commercial intercourse, urges on the establishment of an independent form of
value, and finds no rest until it is once for all satisfied by the
differentiation of commodities into commodities and money. At the same rate,
then, as the conversion of products into commodities is being accomplished, so
also is the conversion of one special commodity into money.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn52" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref52"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The direct
barter of products attains the elementary form of the relative expression of
value in one respect, but not in another. That form is x Commodity A = y
Commodity B. The form of direct barter is x use-value A = y use-value B.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn53" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref53"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> The articles A and B in this case are not
as yet commodities, but become so only by the act of barter. The first step
made by an object of utility towards acquiring exchange-value is when it forms
a non-use-value for its owner, and that happens when it forms a superfluous
portion of some article required for his immediate wants. Objects in themselves
are external to man, and consequently alienable by him. In order that this
alienation may be reciprocal, it is only necessary for men, by a tacit
understanding, to treat each other as private owners of those alienable
objects, and by implication as independent individuals. But such a state of
reciprocal independence has no existence in a primitive society based on
property in common, whether such a society takes the form of a patriarchal
family, an ancient Indian community, or a Peruvian Inca State. The exchange of
commodities, therefore, first begins on the boundaries of such communities, at
their points of contact with other similar communities, or with members of the
latter. So soon, however, as products once become commodities in the external
relations of a community, they also, by reaction, become so in its internal
intercourse. The proportions in which they are exchangeable are at first quite
a matter of chance. What makes them exchangeable is the mutual desire of their
owners to alienate them. Meantime the need for foreign objects of utility
gradually establishes itself. The constant repetition of exchange makes it a
normal social act. In the course of time, therefore, some portion at least of
the products of labour must be produced with a special view to exchange. From
that moment the distinction becomes firmly established between the utility of
an object for the purposes of consumption, and its utility for the purposes of
exchange. Its use-value becomes distinguished from its exchange-value. On the
other hand, the quantitative proportion in which the articles are exchangeable,
becomes dependent on their production itself. Custom stamps them as values with
definite magnitudes. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
direct barter of products, each commodity is directly a means of exchange to
its owner, and to all other persons an equivalent, but that only in so far as
it has use-value for them. At this stage, therefore, the articles exchanged do
not acquire a value-form independent of their own use-value, or of the
individual needs of the exchangers. The necessity for a value-form grows with
the increasing number and variety of the commodities exchanged. The problem and
the means of solution arise simultaneously. Commodity-owners never equate their
own commodities to those of others, and exchange them on a large scale, without
different kinds of commodities belonging to different owners being exchangeable
for, and equated as values to, one and the same special article. Such
last-mentioned article, by becoming the equivalent of various other
commodities, acquires at once, though within narrow limits, the character of a
general social equivalent. This character comes and goes with the momentary
social acts that called it into life. In turns and transiently it attaches
itself first to this and then to that commodity. But with the development of
exchange it fixes itself firmly and exclusively to particular sorts of
commodities, and becomes crystallised by assuming the money-form. The
particular kind of commodity to which it sticks is at first a matter of
accident. Nevertheless there are two circumstances whose influence is decisive.
The money-form attaches itself either to the most important articles of
exchange from outside, and these in fact are primitive and natural forms in
which the exchange-value of home products finds expression; or else it attaches
itself to the object of utility that forms, like cattle, the chief portion of
indigenous alienable wealth. Nomad races are the first to develop the
money-form, because all their worldly goods consist of moveable objects and are
therefore directly alienable; and because their mode of life, by continually
bringing them into contact with foreign communities, solicits the exchange of
products. Man has often made man himself, under the form of slaves, serve as
the primitive material of money, but has never used land for that purpose. Such
an idea could only spring up in a bourgeois society already well developed. It
dates from the last third of the 17th century, and the first attempt to put it
in practice on a national scale was made a century afterwards, during the
French bourgeois revolution. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In
proportion as exchange bursts its local bonds, and the value of commodities
more and more expands into an embodiment of human labour in the abstract, in
the same proportion the character of money attaches itself to commodities that
are by Nature fitted to perform the social function of a universal equivalent.
Those commodities are the precious metals. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The truth
of the proposition that, âalthough gold and silver are not by Nature money,
money is by Nature gold and silver,â<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn54" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref54"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a>
is shown by the fitness of the physical properties of these metals for the
functions of money.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn55" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref55"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a> Up to this
point, however, we are acquainted only with one function of money, namely, to
serve as the form of manifestation of the value of commodities, or as the
material in which the magnitudes of their values are socially expressed. An
adequate form of manifestation of value, a fit embodiment of abstract,
undifferentiated, and therefore equal human labour, that material alone can be
whose every sample exhibits the same uniform qualities. On the other hand,
since the difference between the magnitudes of value is purely quantitative,
the money commodity must be susceptible of merely quantitative differences,
must therefore be divisible at will, and equally capable of being reunited.
Gold and silver possess these properties by Nature. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
use-value of the money-commodity becomes two-fold. In addition to its special
use-value as a commodity (gold, for instance, serving to stop teeth, to form
the raw material of articles of luxury, &amp;c.), it acquires a formal
use-value, originating in its specific social function. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Since all
commodities are merely particular equivalents of money, the latter being their
universal equivalent, they, with regard to the latter as the universal
commodity, play the parts of particular commodities. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn56" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref56"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We have
seen that the money-form is but the reflex, thrown upon one single commodity,
of the value relations between all the rest. That money is a commodity<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn57" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref57"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a> is therefore a new discovery only for
those who, when they analyse it, start from its fully developed shape. The act
of exchange gives to the commodity converted into money, not its value, but its
specific value-form. By confounding these two distinct things some writers have
been led to hold that the value of gold and silver is imaginary.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn58" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref58"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a> The fact that money can, in certain
functions, be replaced by mere symbols of itself, gave rise to that other
mistaken notion, that it is itself a mere symbol. Nevertheless under this error
lurked a presentiment that the money-form of an object is not an inseparable
part of that object, but is simply the form under which certain social
relations manifest themselves. In this sense every commodity is a symbol,
since, in so far as it is value, it is only the material envelope of the human
labour spent upon it.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn59" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref59"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a> But if it
be declared that the social characters assumed by objects, or the material
forms assumed by the social qualities of labour under the rÃ©gime of a definite
mode of production, are mere symbols, it is in the same breath also declared
that these characteristics are arbitrary fictions sanctioned by the so-called
universal consent of mankind. This suited the mode of explanation in favour
during the 18th century. Unable to account for the origin of the puzzling forms
assumed by social relations between man and man, people sought to denude them
of their strange appearance by ascribing to them a conventional origin. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="12b"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It has
already been remarked above that the equivalent form of a commodity does not
imply the determination of the magnitude of its value. Therefore, although we
may be aware that gold is money, and consequently directly exchangeable for all
other commodities, yet that fact by no means tells how much 10 lbs., for
instance, of gold is worth. Money, like every other commodity, cannot express
the magnitude of its value except relatively in other commodities. This value
is determined by the labour-time required for its production, and is expressed
by the quantity of any other commodity that costs the same amount of
labour-time.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn60" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref60"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a><span>Â  </span>Such quantitative determination of its
relative value takes place at the source of its production by means of barter.
When it steps into circulation as money, its value is already given. In the
last decades of the 17th century it had already been shown that money is a
commodity, but this step marks only the infancy of the analysis. The difficulty
lies, not in comprehending that money is a commodity, but in discovering how,
why, and by what means a commodity becomes money.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn61" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref61"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">13</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We have
already seen, from the most elementary expression of value, x commodity A = y
commodity B, that the object in which the magnitude of the value of another
object is represented, appears to have the equivalent form independently of
this relation, as a social property given to it by Nature. We followed up this
false appearance to its final establishment, which is complete so soon as the
universal equivalent form becomes identified with the bodily form of a
particular commodity, and thus crystallised into the money-form. What appears
to happen is, not that gold becomes money, in consequence of all other
commodities expressing their values in it, but, on the contrary, that all other
commodities universally express their values in gold, because it is money. The
intermediate steps of the process vanish in the result and leave no trace
behind. Commodities find their own value already completely represented,
without any initiative on their part, in another commodity existing in company
with them. These objects, gold and silver, just as they come out of the bowels
of the earth, are forthwith the direct incarnation of all human labour. Hence
the magic of money. In the form of society now under consideration, the
behaviour of men in the social process of production is purely atomic. Hence
their relations to each other in production assume a material character
independent of their control and conscious individual action. These facts
manifest themselves at first by products as a general rule taking the form of
commodities. We have seen how the progressive development of a society of
commodity-producers stamps one privileged commodity with the character of
money. Hence the riddle presented by money is but the riddle presented by
commodities; only it now strikes us in its most glaring form. </span></p>
