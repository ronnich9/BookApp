<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The circulation of commodities is the
starting-point of capital. The production of commodities, their circulation,
and that more developed form of their circulation called commerce, these form
the historical ground-work from which it rises. The modern history of capital
dates from the creation in the 16th century of a world-embracing commerce and a
world-embracing market. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If we abstract from the material substance of
the circulation of commodities, that is, from the exchange of the various
use-values, and consider only the economic forms produced by this process of
circulation, we find its final result to be money: this final product of the circulation
of commodities is the first form in which capital appears. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="1a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As a matter of history, capital, as opposed to
landed property, invariably takes the form at first of money; it appears as
moneyed wealth, as the capital of the merchant and of the usurer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn130" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref130"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> But we have no need to refer to the origin
of capital in order to discover that the first form of appearance of capital is
money. We can see it daily under our very eyes. All new capital, to commence
with, comes on the stage, that is, on the market, whether of commodities,
labour, or money, even in our days, in the shape of money that by a definite
process has to be transformed into capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The first distinction we notice between money
that is money only, and money that is capital, is nothing more than a
difference in their form of circulation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The simplest form of the circulation of
commodities is C-M-C, the transformation of commodities into money, and the
change of the money back again into commodities; or selling in order to buy.
But alongside of this form we find another specifically different form: M-C-M,
the transformation of money into commodities, and the change of commodities
back again into money; or buying in order to sell. Money that circulates in the
latter manner is thereby transformed into, becomes capital, and is already
potentially capital. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="2a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Now let us examine the circuit M-C-M a little
closer. It consists, like the other, of two antithetical phases. In the first
phase, M-C, or the purchase, the money is changed into a commodity. In the second
phase, C-M, or the sale, the commodity is changed back again into money. The
combination of these two phases constitutes the single movement whereby money
is exchanged for a commodity, and the same commodity is again exchanged for
money; whereby a commodity is bought in order to be sold, or, neglecting the
distinction in form between buying and selling, whereby a commodity is bought
with money, and then money is bought with a commodity. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn131" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref131"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a> The result, in which the phases of the
process vanish, is the exchange of money for money, M-M. If I purchase 2,000
lbs. of cotton for £100, and resell the 2,000 lbs. of cotton for £110, I have,
in fact, exchanged £100 for £110, money for money. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Now it is evident that the circuit M-C-M would
be absurd and without meaning if the intention were to exchange by this means
two equal sums of money, £100 for £100. The miser’s plan would be far simpler
and surer; he sticks to his £100 instead of exposing it to the dangers of
circulation. And yet, whether the merchant who has paid £100 for his cotton
sells it for £110, or lets it go for £100, or even £50, his money has, at all
events, gone through a characteristic and original movement, quite different in
kind from that which it goes through in the hands of the peasant who sells
corn, and with the money thus set free buys clothes. We have therefore to
examine first the distinguishing characteristics of the forms of the circuits
M-C-M and C-M-C, and in doing this the real difference that underlies the mere
difference of form will reveal itself. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us see, in the first place, what the two
forms have in common. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Both circuits are resolvable into the same two
antithetical phases, C-M, a sale, and M-C, a purchase. In each of these phases
the same material elements - a commodity, and money, and the same economic
dramatis personae, a buyer and a seller - confront one another. Each circuit is
the unity of the same two antithetical phases, and in each case this unity is
brought about by the intervention of three contracting parties, of whom one
only sells, another only buys, while the third both buys and sells. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">What, however, first and foremost distinguishes
the circuit C-M-C from the circuit M-C-M, is the inverted order of succession
of the two phases. The simple circulation of commodities begins with a sale and
ends with a purchase, while the circulation of money as capital begins with a
purchase and ends with a sale. In the one case both the starting-point and the
goal are commodities, in the other they are money. In the first form the
movement is brought about by the intervention of money, in the second by that
of a commodity. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="3a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the circulation C-M-C, the money is in the
end converted into a commodity, that serves as a use-value; it is spent once
for all. In the inverted form, M-C-M, on the contrary, the buyer lays out money
in order that, as a seller, he may recover money. By the purchase of his
commodity he throws money into circulation, in order to withdraw it again by
the sale of the same commodity. He lets the money go, but only with the sly
intention of getting it back again. The money, therefore, is not spent, it is
merely advanced. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn132" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref132"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the circuit C-M-C, the same piece of money
changes its place twice. The seller gets it from the buyer and pays it away to
another seller. The complete circulation, which begins with the receipt,
concludes with the payment, of money for commodities. It is the very contrary
in the circuit M-C-M. Here it is not the piece of money that changes its place
twice, but the commodity. The buyer takes it from the hands of the seller and
passes it into the hands of another buyer. Just as in the simple circulation of
commodities the double change of place of the same piece of money effects its
passage from one hand into another, so here the double change of place of the
same commodity brings about the reflux of the money to its point of departure. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Such reflux is not dependent on the commodity
being sold for more than was paid for it. This circumstance influences only the
amount of the money that comes back. The reflux itself takes place, so soon as
the purchased commodity is resold, in other words, so soon as the circuit M-C-M
is completed. We have here, therefore, a palpable difference between the
circulation of money as capital, and its circulation as mere money. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The circuit C-M-C comes completely to an end, so
soon as the money brought in by the sale of one commodity is abstracted again
by the purchase of another. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If, nevertheless, there follows a reflux of
money to its starting-point, this can only happen through a renewal or
repetition of the operation. If I sell a quarter of corn for £3, and with this
£3 buy clothes, the money, so far as I am concerned, is spent and done with. It
belongs to the clothes merchant. If I now sell a second quarter of corn, money
indeed flows back to me, not however as a sequel to the first transaction, but
in consequence of its repetition. The money again leaves me, so soon as I
complete this second transaction by a fresh purchase. Therefore, in the circuit
C-M-C, the expenditure of money has nothing to do with its reflux. On the other
hand, in M-C-M, the reflux of the money is conditioned by the very mode of its
expenditure. Without this reflux, the operation fails, or the process is
interrupted and incomplete, owing to the absence of its complementary and final
phase, the sale. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The circuit C-M-C starts with one commodity, and
finishes with another, which falls out of circulation and into consumption.
Consumption, the satisfaction of wants, in one word, use-value, is its end and
aim. The circuit M-C-M, on the contrary, commences with money and ends with
money. Its leading motive, and the goal that attracts it, is therefore mere
exchange-value. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="4a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the simple circulation of commodities, the
two extremes of the circuit have the same economic form. They are both
commodities, and commodities of equal value. But they are also use-values
differing in their qualities, as, for example, corn and clothes. The exchange
of products, of the different materials in which the labour of society is
embodied, forms here the basis of the movement. It is otherwise in the
circulation M-C-M, which at first sight appears purposeless, because
tautological. Both extremes have the same economic form. They are both money,
and therefore are not qualitatively different use-values; for money is but the
converted form of commodities, in which their particular use-values vanish. To
exchange £100 for cotton, and then this same cotton again for £100, is merely a
roundabout way of exchanging money for money, the same for the same, and
appears to be an operation just as purposeless as it is absurd. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn133" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref133"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> One sum of money is distinguishable from
another only by its amount. The character and tendency of the process M-C-M, is
therefore not due to any qualitative difference between its extremes, both
being money, but solely to their quantitative difference. More money is
withdrawn from circulation at the finish than was thrown into it at the start.
The cotton that was bought for £100 is perhaps resold for £100 + £10 or £110. The
exact form of this process is therefore M-C-M', where M' = M + D M = the
original sum advanced, plus an increment. This increment or excess over the
original value I call “surplus-value.” The value originally advanced,
therefore, not only remains intact while in circulation, but adds to itself a surplus-value
or expands itself. It is this movement that converts it into capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Of course, it is also possible, that in C-M-C,
the two extremes C-C, say corn and clothes, may represent different quantities
of value. The farmer may sell his corn above its value, or may buy the clothes
at less than their value. He may, on the other hand, “be done” by the clothes
merchant. Yet, in the form of circulation now under consideration, such
differences in value are purely accidental. The fact that the corn and the
clothes are equivalents, does not deprive the process of all meaning, as it
does in M-C-M. The equivalence of their values is rather a necessary condition
to its normal course. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The repetition or renewal of the act of selling
in order to buy, is kept within bounds by the very object it aims at, namely,
consumption or the satisfaction of definite wants, an aim that lies altogether
outside the sphere of circulation. But when we buy in order to sell, we, on the
contrary, begin and end with the same thing, money, exchange-value; and thereby
the movement becomes interminable. No doubt, M becomes M + D M, £100 become
£110. But when viewed in their qualitative aspect alone, £110 are the same as
£100, namely money; and considered quantitatively, £110 is, like £100, a sum of
definite and limited value. If now, the £110 be spent as money, they cease to
play their part. They are no longer capital. Withdrawn from circulation, they
become petrified into a hoard, and though they remained in that state till
doomsday, not a single farthing would accrue to them. If, then, the expansion
of value is once aimed at, there is just the same inducement to augment the
value of the £110 <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="5a"></a>as that of the £100; for both are but limited
expressions for exchange-value, and therefore both have the same vocation to
approach, by quantitative increase, as near as possible to absolute wealth. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="6a"></a>Momentarily, indeed, the value originally advanced, the £100 is
distinguishable from the surplus-value of £10 that is annexed to it during
circulation; but the distinction vanishes immediately. At the end of the
process, we do not receive with one hand the original £100, and with the other,
the surplus-value of £10. We simply get a value of £110, which is in exactly
the same condition and fitness for commencing the expanding process, as the
original £100 was. Money ends the movement only to begin it again.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn134" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref134"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> Therefore, the final result of every
separate circuit, in which a purchase and consequent sale are completed, forms
of itself the starting-point of a new circuit. The simple circulation of
commodities - selling in order to buy - is a means of carrying out a purpose
unconnected with circulation, namely, the appropriation of use-values, the
satisfaction of wants. The circulation of money as capital is, on the contrary,
an end in itself, for the expansion of value takes place only within this
constantly renewed movement. The circulation of capital has therefore no
limits.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn135" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref135"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="11a"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="10a"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="9a"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="8a"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="7a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As the conscious representative of this movement,
the possessor of money becomes a capitalist. His person, or rather his pocket,
is the point from which the money starts and to which it returns. The expansion
of value, which is the objective basis or main-spring of the circulation M-C-M,
becomes his subjective aim, and it is only in so far as the appropriation of
ever more and more wealth in the abstract becomes the sole motive of his
operations, that he functions as a capitalist, that is, as capital personified
and endowed with consciousness and a will. Use-values must therefore never be
looked upon as the real aim of the capitalist; <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn136" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref136"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a><sup class="calibre15">
</sup>neither must the profit on any single transaction. The restless
never-ending process of profit-making alone is what he aims at.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn137" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref137"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a> This boundless greed after riches, this
passionate chase after exchange-value<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn138" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref138"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a>,
is common to the capitalist and the miser; but while the miser is merely a
capitalist gone mad, the capitalist is a rational miser. The never-ending
augmentation of exchange-value, which the miser strives after, by seeking to
save<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn139" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref139"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a> his money from circulation, is attained
by the more acute capitalist, by constantly throwing it afresh into
circulation.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn140" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref140"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="13a"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="12a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The independent form, <i class="calibre4">i.e.</i>, the
money-form, which the value of commodities assumes in the case of simple
circulation, serves only one purpose, namely, their exchange, and vanishes in
the final result of the movement. On the other hand, in the circulation M-C-M,
both the money and the commodity represent only different modes of existence of
value itself, the money its general mode, and the commodity its particular, or,
so to say, disguised mode.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn141" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref141"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a><span>  </span>It is constantly changing from one form to
the other without thereby becoming lost, and thus assumes an automatically
active character. If now we take in turn each of the two different forms which
self-expanding value successively assumes in the course of its life, we then
arrive at these two propositions: Capital is money: Capital is commodities.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn142" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref142"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">13</span></a> In truth, however, value is here the
active factor in a process, in which, while constantly assuming the form in
turn of money and commodities, it at the same time changes in magnitude,
differentiates itself by throwing off surplus-value from itself; the original
value, in other words, expands spontaneously. For the movement, in the course
of which it adds surplus-value, is its own movement, its expansion, therefore,
is automatic expansion. Because it is value, it has acquired the occult quality
of being able to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at
the least, lays golden eggs. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Value, therefore, being the active factor in
such a process, and assuming at one time the form of money, at another that of
commodities, but through all these changes preserving itself and expanding, it
requires some independent form, by means of which its identity may at any time
be established. And this form it possesses only in the shape of money. It is
under the form of money that value begins and ends, and begins again, every act
of its own spontaneous generation. It began by being £100, it is now £110, and
so on. But the money itself is only one of the two forms of value. Unless it
takes the form of some commodity, it does not become capital. There is here no
antagonism, as in the case of hoarding, between the money and commodities. The
capitalist knows that all commodities, however scurvy they may look, or however
badly they may smell, are in faith and in truth money, inwardly circumcised
Jews, and what is more, a wonderful means whereby out of money to make more
money. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In simple circulation, C-M-C, the value of
commodities attained at the most a form independent of their use-values, <i class="calibre4">i.e.</i>,
the form of money; but that same value now in the circulation M-C-M, or the
circulation of capital, suddenly presents itself as an independent substance,
endowed with a motion of its own, passing through a life-process of its own, in
which money and commodities are mere forms which it assumes and casts off in
turn. Nay, more: instead of simply representing the relations of commodities,
it enters now, so to say, into private relations with itself. It differentiates
itself as original value from itself as surplus-value; as the father
differentiates himself from himself qua the son, yet both are one and of one
age: for only by the surplus-value of £10 does the £100 originally advanced
become capital, and so soon as this takes place, so soon as the son, and by the
son, the father, is begotten, so soon does their difference vanish, and they
again become one, £110. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="14a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Value therefore now becomes value in process,
money in process, and, as such, capital. It comes out of circulation, enters
into it again, preserves and multiplies itself within its circuit, comes back
out of it with expanded bulk, and begins the same round ever afresh.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn143" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref143"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">14</span></a> M-M', money which begets money, such is
the description of Capital from the mouths of its first interpreters, the
Mercantilists. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Buying in order to sell, or, more accurately,
buying in order to sell dearer, M-C-M', appears certainly to be a form peculiar
to one kind of capital alone, namely, merchants’ capital. But industrial
capital too is money, that is changed into commodities, and by the sale of
these commodities, is re-converted into more money. The events that take place
outside the sphere of circulation, in the interval between the buying and
selling, do not affect the form of this movement. Lastly, in the case of
interest-bearing capital, the circulation M-C-M' appears abridged. We have its
result without the intermediate stage, in the form M-M', “en style lapidaire” so
to say, money that is worth more money, value that is greater than itself. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal6"><span lang="EN-GB">M-C-M' is therefore in reality the general formula of capital as it
appears prima facie within the sphere of circulation. </span></p>
