Formula of Capital</span></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The form
which circulation takes when money becomes capital, is opposed to all the laws
we have hitherto investigated bearing on the nature of commodities, value and
money, and even of circulation itself. What distinguishes this form from that
of the simple circulation of commodities, is the inverted order of succession
of the two antithetical processes, sale and purchase. How can this purely
formal distinction between these processes change their character as it were by
magic? </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But that is
not all. This inversion has no existence for two out of the three persons who
transact business together. As capitalist, I buy commodities from A and sell
them again to B, but as a simple owner of commodities, I sell them to B and
then purchase fresh ones from A. A and B see no difference between the two sets
of transactions. They are merely buyers or sellers. And I on each occasion meet
them as a mere owner of either money or commodities, as a buyer or a seller,
and, what is more, in both sets of transactions, I am opposed to A only as a
buyer and to B only as a seller, to the one only as money, to the other only as
commodities, and to neither of them as capital or a capitalist, or as
representative of anything that is more than money or commodities, or that can
produce any effect beyond what money and commodities can. For me the purchase
from A and the sale to B are part of a series. But the connexion between the
two acts exists for me alone. A does not trouble himself about my transaction
with B, nor does B about my business with A. And if I offered to explain to
them the meritorious nature of my action in inverting the order of succession,
they would probably point out to me that I was mistaken as to that order of
succession, and that the whole transaction, instead of beginning with a
purchase and ending with a sale, began, on the contrary, with a sale and was
concluded with a purchase. In truth, my first act, the purchase, was from the
standpoint of A, a sale, and my second act, the sale, was from the standpoint
of B, a purchase. Not content with that, A and B would declare that the whole
series was superfluous and nothing but Hokus Pokus; that for the future A would
buy direct from B, and B sell direct to A. Thus the whole transaction would be
reduced to a single act forming an isolated, non-complemented phase in the
ordinary circulation of commodities, a mere sale from A’s point of view, and
from B’s, a mere purchase. The inversion, therefore, of the order of
succession, does not take us outside the sphere of the simple circulation of
commodities, and we must rather look, whether there is in this simple
circulation anything permitting an expansion of the value that enters into
circulation, and, consequently, a creation of surplus-value. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us take
the process of circulation in a form under which it presents itself as a simple
and direct exchange of commodities. This is always the case when two owners of
commodities buy from each other, and on the settling day the amounts mutually
owing are equal and cancel each other. The money in this case is money of
account and serves to express the value of the commodities by their prices, but
is not, itself, in the shape of hard cash, confronted with them. So far as
regards use-values, it is clear that both parties may gain some advantage. Both
part with goods that, as use-values, are of no service to them, and receive
others that they can make use of. And there may also be a further gain. A, who
sells wine and buys corn, possibly produces more wine, with given labour-time,
than farmer B could, and B on the other hand, more corn than wine-grower A
could. A, therefore, may get, for the same exchange-value, more corn, and B
more wine, than each would respectively get without any exchange by producing
his own corn and wine. With reference, therefore, to use-value, there is good
ground for saying that “exchange is a transaction by which both sides gain.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn144" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref144"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> It is otherwise with exchange-value. “A
man who has plenty of wine and no corn treats with a man who has plenty of corn
and no wine; an exchange takes place between them of corn to the value of 50,
for wine of the same value. This act produces no increase of exchange-value
either for the one or the other; for each of them already possessed, before the
exchange, a value equal to that which he acquired by means of that operation.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn145" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref145"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a> The result is not altered by introducing
money, as a medium of circulation, between the commodities, and making the sale
and the purchase two distinct acts.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn146" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref146"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a>
The value of a commodity is expressed in its price before it goes into
circulation, and is therefore a precedent condition of circulation, not its
result.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn147" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref147"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Abstractedly
considered, that is, apart from circumstances not immediately flowing from the
laws of the simple circulation of commodities, there is in an exchange nothing
(if we except the replacing of one use-value by another) but a metamorphosis, a
mere change in the form of the commodity. The same exchange-value, i.e., the
same quantity of incorporated social labour, remains throughout in the hands of
the owner of the commodity, first in the shape of his own commodity, then in
the form of the money for which he exchanged it, and lastly, in the shape of
the commodity he buys with that money. This change of form does not imply a
change in the magnitude of the value. But the change, which the value of the
commodity undergoes in this process, is limited to a change in its money-form.
This form exists first as the price of the commodity offered for sale, then as
an actual sum of money, which, however, was already expressed in the price, and
lastly, as the price of an equivalent commodity. This change of form no more
implies, taken alone, a change in the quantity of value, than does the change
of a £5 note into sovereigns, half sovereigns and shillings. So far therefore
as the circulation of commodities effects a change in the form alone of their
values, and is free from disturbing influences, it must be the exchange of
equivalents. Little as Vulgar-Economy knows about the nature of value, yet
whenever it wishes to consider the phenomena of circulation in their purity, it
assumes that supply and demand are equal, which amounts to this, that their
effect is nil. If therefore, as regards the use-values exchanged, both buyer
and seller may possibly gain something, this is not the case as regards the
exchange-values. Here we must rather say, “Where equality exists there can be
no gain.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn148" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref148"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> It is true, commodities may
be sold at prices deviating from their values, but these deviations are to be
considered as infractions of the laws of the exchange of commodities<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn149" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref149"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a>, which in its normal state is an exchange
of equivalents, consequently, no method for increasing value.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn150" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref150"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hence, we
see that behind all attempts to represent the circulation of commodities as a
source of surplus-value, there lurks a <em class="calibre4">quid pro quo</em>, a mixing up of
use-value and exchange-value. For instance, Condillac says: “It is not true
that on an exchange of commodities we give value for value. On the contrary,
each of the two contracting parties in every case, gives a less for a greater
value. ... If we really exchanged equal values, neither party could make a
profit. And yet, they both gain, or ought to gain. Why? The value of a thing
consists solely in its relation to our wants. What is more to the one is less to
the other, and <em class="calibre4">vice versâ</em>. ... It is not to be assumed that we offer
for sale articles required for our own consumption. ... We wish to part with a
useless thing, in order to get one that we need; we want to give less for more.
... It was natural to think that, in an exchange, value was given for value,
whenever each of the articles exchanged was of equal value with the same
quantity of gold. ... But there is another point to be considered in our
calculation. The question is, whether we both exchange something superfluous
for something necessary.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn151" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref151"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a> We see in
this passage, how Condillac not only confuses use-value with exchange-value,
but in a really childish manner assumes, that in a society, in which the
production of commodities is well developed, each producer produces his own
means of subsistence, and throws into circulation only the excess over his own
requirements<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn152" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref152"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a> Still, Condillac’s argument
is frequently used by modern economists, more especially when the point is to
show, that the exchange of commodities in its developed form, commerce, is
productive of surplus-value. For instance, “Commerce ... adds value to
products, for the same products in the hands of consumers, are worth more than
in the hands of producers, and it may strictly be considered an act of
production.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_053.htm#_edn153" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref153"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a> But commodities are not
paid for twice over, once on account of their use-value, and again on account
of their value. And though the use-value of a commodity is more serviceable to
the buyer than to the seller, its money-form is more serviceable to the seller.
Would he otherwise sell it? We might therefore just as well say that the buyer
performs “strictly an act of production,” by converting stockings, for example,
into money. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If
commodities, or commodities and money, of equal exchange-value, and
consequently equivalents, are exchanged, it is plain that no one abstracts more
value from, than he throws into, circulation. There is no creation of surplus-value.
And, in its normal form, the circulation of commodities demands the exchange of
equivalents. But in actual practice, the process does not retain its normal
form. Let us, therefore, assume an exchange of non-equivalents. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In any case
the market for commodities is only frequented by owners of commodities, and the
power which these persons exercise over each other, is no other than the power
of their commodities. The material variety of these commodities is the material
incentive to the act of exchange, and makes buyers and sellers mutually
dependent, because none of them possesses the object of his own wants, and each
holds in his hand the object of another’s wants. Besides these material
differences of their use-values, there is only one other difference between
commodities, namely, that between their bodily form and the form into which
they are converted by sale, the difference between commodities and money. And
consequently the owners of commodities are distinguishable only as sellers,
those who own commodities, and buyers, those who own money. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Suppose
then, that by some inexplicable privilege, the seller is enabled to sell his
commodities above their value, what is worth 100 for 110, in which case the
price is nominally raised 10%. The seller therefore pockets a surplus-value of
10. But after he has sold he becomes a buyer. A third owner of commodities
comes to him now as seller, who in this capacity also enjoys the privilege of
selling his commodities 10% too dear. Our friend gained 10 as a seller only to
lose it again as a buyer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn154" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref154"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a> The net
result is, that all owners of commodities sell their goods to one another at
10% above their value, which comes precisely to the same as if they sold them
at their true value. Such a general and nominal rise of prices has the same
effect as if the values had been expressed in weight of silver instead of in
weight of gold. The nominal prices of commodities would rise, but the real
relation between their values would remain unchanged. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us make
the opposite assumption, that the buyer has the privilege of purchasing
commodities under their value. In this case it is no longer necessary to bear
in mind that he in his turn will become a seller. He was so before he became
buyer; he had already lost 10% in selling before he gained 10% as buyer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn155" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref155"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a> Everything is just as it was. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
creation of surplus-value, and therefore the conversion of money into capital,
can consequently be explained neither on the assumption that commodities are
sold above their value, nor that they are bought below their value.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn156" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref156"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">13</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="15a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The problem
is in no way simplified by introducing irrelevant matters after the manner of
Col. Torrens: “Effectual demand consists in the power and inclination (!), on
the part of consumers, to give for commodities, either by immediate or
circuitous barter, some greater portion of ... capital than their production
costs.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn157" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref157"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">14</span></a> In relation to
circulation, producers and consumers meet only as buyers and sellers. To assert
that the surplus-value acquired by the producer has its origin in the fact that
consumers pay for commodities more than their value, is only to say in other
words: The owner of commodities possesses, as a seller, the privilege of
selling too dear. The seller has himself produced the commodities or represents
their producer, but the buyer has to no less extent produced the commodities
represented by his money, or represents their producer. The distinction between
them is, that one buys and the other sells. The fact that the owner of the
commodities, under the designation of producer, sells them over their value,
and under the designation of consumer, pays too much for them, does not carry
us a single step further.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn158" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref158"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">15</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="16a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To be
consistent therefore, the upholders of the delusion that surplus-value has its
origin in a nominal rise of prices or in the privilege which the seller has of
selling too dear, must assume the existence of a class that only buys and does
not sell, i.e., only consumes and does not produce. The existence of such a
class is inexplicable from the standpoint we have so far reached, viz., that of
simple circulation. But let us anticipate. The money with which such a class is
constantly making purchases, must constantly flow into their pockets, without
any exchange, gratis, by might or right, from the pockets of the
commodity-owners themselves. To sell commodities above their value to such a
class, is only to crib back again a part of the money previously given to it.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn159" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref159"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">16</span></a> The towns of Asia Minor thus paid a
yearly money tribute to ancient Rome. With this money Rome purchased from them
commodities, and purchased them too dear. The provincials cheated the Romans,
and thus got back from their conquerors, in the course of trade, a portion of
the tribute. Yet, for all that, the conquered were the really cheated. Their
goods were still paid for with their own money. That is not the way to get rich
or to create surplus-value. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us
therefore keep within the bounds of exchange where sellers are also buyers, and
buyers, sellers. Our difficulty may perhaps have arisen from treating the
actors as personifications instead of as individuals. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="17a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A may be
clever enough to get the advantage of B or C without their being able to
retaliate. A sells wine worth £40 to B, and obtains from him in exchange corn
to the value of £50. A has converted his £40 into £50, has made more money out
of less, and has converted his commodities into capital. Let us examine this a
little more closely. Before the exchange we had £40 worth of wine in the hands
of A, and £50 worth of corn in those of B, a total value of £90. After the
exchange we have still the same total value of £90. The value in circulation
has not increased by one iota, it is only distributed differently between A and
B. What is a loss of value to B is surplus-value to A; what is “minus” to one
is “plus” to the other. The same change would have taken place, if A, without
the formality of an exchange, had directly stolen the £10 from B. The sum of
the values in circulation can clearly not be augmented by any change in their
distribution, any more than the quantity of the precious metals in a country by
a Jew selling a Queen Anne’s farthing for a guinea. The capitalist class, as a
whole, in any country, cannot over-reach themselves.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn160" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref160"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">17</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="19a"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="18a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Turn and
twist then as we may, the fact remains unaltered. If equivalents are exchanged,
no surplus-value results, and if non-equivalents are exchanged, still no surplus-value.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn161" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref161"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">18</span></a><span> 
</span>Circulation, or the exchange of commodities, begets no value.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn162" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref162"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">19</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The reason
is now therefore plain why, in analysing the standard form of capital, the form
under which it determines the economic organisation of modern society, we
entirely left out of consideration its most popular, and, so to say,
antediluvian forms, merchants’ capital and money-lenders’ capital. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="21a"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="20a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The circuit
M-C-M, buying in order to sell dearer, is seen most clearly in genuine
merchants’ capital. But the movement takes place entirely within the sphere of
circulation. Since, however, it is impossible, by circulation alone, to account
for the conversion of money into capital, for the formation of surplus-value,
it would appear, that merchants’ capital is an impossibility, so long as
equivalents are exchanged;<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn163" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref163"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">20</span></a> that,
therefore, it can only have its origin in the two-fold advantage gained, over
both the selling and the buying producers, by the merchant who parasitically
shoves himself in between them. It is in this sense that Franklin says, “war is
robbery, commerce is generally cheating.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn164" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref164"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">21</span></a>
If the transformation of merchants’ money into capital is to be explained
otherwise than by the producers being simply cheated, a long series of
intermediate steps would be necessary, which, at present, when the simple
circulation of commodities forms our only assumption, are entirely wanting. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="22a"></a></span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-US">What we have said with reference to
merchants’ capital, applies still more to money-lenders’ capital. In merchants’
capital, the two extremes, the money that is thrown upon the market, and the
augmented money that is withdrawn from the market, are at least connected by a
purchase and a sale, in other words by the movement of the circulation. In
money-lenders’ capital the form M-C-M is reduced to the two extremes without a
mean, M-M , money exchanged for more money, a form that is incompatible with
the nature of money, and therefore remains inexplicable from the standpoint of
the circulation of commodities. Hence Aristotle: “since chrematistic is a
double science, one part belonging to commerce, the other to economic, the
latter being necessary and praiseworthy, the former based on circulation and
with justice disapproved (for it is not based on Nature, but on mutual
cheating), therefore the usurer is most rightly hated, because money itself is
the source of his gain, and is not used for the purposes for which it was
invented. For it originated for the exchange of commodities, but interest makes
out of money, more money. Hence its name (τοκος
interest and offspring). For the begotten are like those who beget them. But
interest is money of money, so that of all modes of making a living, this is
the most contrary to Nature.”</span><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn165" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref165"><span class="EndnoteCharacters"><span lang="EN-GB">22</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
course of our investigation, we shall find that both merchants’ capital and
interest-bearing capital are derivative forms, and at the same time it will
become clear, why these two forms appear in the course of history before the
modern standard form of capital. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="23a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We have
shown that surplus-value cannot be created by circulation, and, therefore, that
in its formation, something must take place in the background, which is not
apparent in the circulation itself.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn166" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref166"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">23</span></a>
But can surplus-value possibly originate anywhere else than in circulation,
which is the sum total of all the mutual relations of commodity-owners, as far
as they are determined by their commodities? Apart from circulation, the
commodity-owner is in relation only with his own commodity. So far as regards
value, that relation is limited to this, that the commodity contains a quantity
of his own labour, that quantity being measured by a definite social standard.
This quantity is expressed by the value of the commodity, and since the value
is reckoned in money of account, this quantity is also expressed by the price,
which we will suppose to be £10. But his labour is not represented both by the
value of the commodity, and by a surplus over that value, not by a price of 10
that is also a price of 11, not by a value that is greater than itself. The
commodity owner can, by his labour, create value, but not self-expanding value.
He can increase the value of his commodity, by adding fresh labour, and
therefore more value to the value in hand, by making, for instance, leather
into boots. The same material has now more value, because it contains a greater
quantity of labour. The boots have therefore more value than the leather, but
the value of the leather remains what it was; it has not expanded itself, has
not, during the making of the boots, annexed surplus-value. It is therefore
impossible that outside the sphere of circulation, a producer of commodities
can, without coming into contact with other commodity-owners, expand value, and
consequently convert money or commodities into capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is
therefore impossible for capital to be produced by circulation, and it is
equally impossible for it to originate apart from circulation. It must have its
origin both in circulation and yet not in circulation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We have,
therefore, got a double result. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="24a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
conversion of money into capital has to be explained on the basis of the laws
that regulate the exchange of commodities, in such a way that the
starting-point is the exchange of equivalents.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn167" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref167"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">24</span></a>
Our friend, Moneybags, who as yet is only an embryo capitalist, must buy his
commodities at their value, must sell them at their value, and yet at the end
of the process must withdraw more value from circulation than he threw into it
at starting. His development into a full-grown capitalist must take place, both
within the sphere of circulation and without it. These are the conditions of
the problem. <em class="calibre4">Hic Rhodus, hic salta!</em><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn168" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref168"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">25</span></a>
