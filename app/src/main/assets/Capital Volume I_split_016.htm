Labour-Power</span></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The change
of value that occurs in the case of money intended to be converted into
capital, cannot take place in the money itself, since in its function of means
of purchase and of payment, it does no more than realise the price of the
commodity it buys or pays for; and, as hard cash, it is value petrified, never
varying.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn169" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref169"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> Just as little can it
originate in the second act of circulation, the re-sale of the commodity, which
does no more than transform the article from its bodily form back again into
its money-form. The change must, therefore, take place in the commodity bought
by the first act, M-C, but not in its value, for equivalents are exchanged, and
the commodity is paid for at its full value. We are, therefore, forced to the
conclusion that the change originates in the use-value, as such, of the
commodity, i.e., in its consumption. In order to be able to extract value from
the consumption of a commodity, our friend, Moneybags, must be so lucky as to
find, within the sphere of circulation, in the market, a commodity, whose
use-value possesses the peculiar property of being a source of value, whose
actual consumption, therefore, is itself an embodiment of labour, and,
consequently, a creation of value. The possessor of money does find on the
market such a special commodity in capacity for labour or labour-power. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By
labour-power or capacity for labour is to be understood the aggregate of those
mental and physical capabilities existing in a human being, which he exercises
whenever he produces a use-value of any description. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But in
order that our owner of money may be able to find labour-power offered for sale
as a commodity, various conditions must first be fulfilled. The exchange of
commodities of itself implies no other relations of dependence than those which
result from its own nature. On this assumption, labour-power can appear upon
the market as a commodity, only if, and so far as, its possessor, the
individual whose labour-power it is, offers it for sale, or sells it, as a
commodity. In order that he may be able to do this, he must have it at his
disposal, must be the untrammelled owner of his capacity for labour, i.e., of
his person.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn170" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref170"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a> He and the owner of money
meet in the market, and deal with each other as on the basis of equal rights,
with this difference alone, that one is buyer, the other seller; both,
therefore, equal in the eyes of the law. The continuance of this relation
demands that the owner of the labour-power should sell it only for a definite
period, for if he were to sell it rump and stump, once for all, he would be
selling himself, converting himself from a free man into a slave, from an owner
of a commodity into a commodity. He must constantly look upon his labour-power
as his own property, his own commodity, and this he can only do by placing it
at the disposal of the buyer temporarily, for a definite period of time. By
this means alone can he avoid renouncing his rights of ownership over it.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn171" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref171"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The second
essential condition to the owner of money finding labour-power in the market as
a commodity is this – that the labourer instead of being in the position to
sell commodities in which his labour is incorporated, must be obliged to offer
for sale as a commodity that very labour-power, which exists only in his living
self. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In order
that a man may be able to sell commodities other than labour-power, he must of
course have the means of production, as raw material, implements, &amp;c. No
boots can be made without leather. He requires also the means of subsistence.
Nobody – not even “a musician of the future” – can live upon future products,
or upon use-values in an unfinished state; and ever since the first moment of
his appearance on the world’s stage, man always has been, and must still be a
consumer, both before and while he is producing. In a society where all
products assume the form of commodities, these commodities must be sold after
they have been produced, it is only after their sale that they can serve in
satisfying the requirements of their producer. The time necessary for their
sale is superadded to that necessary for their production. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For the
conversion of his money into capital, therefore, the owner of money must meet
in the market with the free labourer, free in the double sense, that as a free
man he can dispose of his labour-power as his own commodity, and that on the
other hand he has no other commodity for sale, is short of everything necessary
for the realisation of his labour-power. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
question why this free labourer confronts him in the market, has no interest
for the owner of money, who regards the labour-market as a branch of the
general market for commodities. And for the present it interests us just as
little. We cling to the fact theoretically, as he does practically. One thing,
however, is clear – Nature does not produce on the one side owners of money or
commodities, and on the other men possessing nothing but their own labour-power.
This relation has no natural basis, neither is its social basis one that is
common to all historical periods. It is clearly the result of a past historical
development, the product of many economic revolutions, of the extinction of a
whole series of older forms of social production. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So, too,
the economic categories, already discussed by us, bear the stamp of history.
Definite historical conditions are necessary that a product may become a
commodity. It must not be produced as the immediate means of subsistence of the
producer himself. Had we gone further, and inquired under what circumstances
all, or even the majority of products take the form of commodities, we should
have found that this can only happen with production of a very specific kind,
capitalist production. Such an inquiry, however, would have been foreign to the
analysis of commodities. Production and circulation of commodities can take
place, although the great mass of the objects produced are intended for the
immediate requirements of their producers, are not turned into commodities, and
consequently social production is not yet by a long way dominated in its length
and breadth by exchange-value. The appearance of products as commodities
pre-supposes such a development of the social division of labour, that the
separation of use-value from exchange-value, a separation which first begins
with barter, must already have been completed. But such a degree of development
is common to many forms of society, which in other respects present the most varying
historical features. On the other hand, if we consider money, its existence
implies a definite stage in the exchange of commodities. The particular
functions of money which it performs, either as the mere equivalent of
commodities, or as means of circulation, or means of payment, as hoard or as
universal money, point, according to the extent and relative preponderance of
the one function or the other, to very different stages in the process of
social production. Yet we know by experience that a circulation of commodities
relatively primitive, suffices for the production of all these forms. Otherwise
with capital. The historical conditions of its existence are by no means given
with the mere circulation of money and commodities. It can spring into life,
only when the owner of the means of production and subsistence meets in the
market with the free labourer selling his labour-power. And this one historical
condition comprises a world’s history. Capital, therefore, announces from its
first appearance a new epoch in the process of social production.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn172" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref172"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We must now
examine more closely this peculiar commodity, labour-power. Like all others it
has a value.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn173" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref173"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> How is that value
determined? </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The value
of labour-power is determined, as in the case of every other commodity, by the
labour-time necessary for the production, and consequently also the
reproduction, of this special article. So far as it has value, it represents no
more than a definite quantity of the average labour of society incorporated in
it. Labour-power exists only as a capacity, or power of the living individual.
Its production consequently pre-supposes his existence. Given the individual,
the production of labour-power consists in his reproduction of himself or his
maintenance. For his maintenance he requires a given quantity of the means of
subsistence. Therefore the labour-time requisite for the production of
labour-power reduces itself to that necessary for the production of those means
of subsistence; in other words, the value of labour-power is the value of the
means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the labourer.
Labour-power, however, becomes a reality only by its exercise; it sets itself
in action only by working. But thereby a definite quantity of human muscle,
nerve, brain, &amp;c., is wasted, and these require to be restored. This
increased expenditure demands a larger income.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn174" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref174"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a>
If the owner of labour-power works to-day, to-morrow he must again be able to
repeat the same process in the same conditions as regards health and strength.
His means of subsistence must therefore be sufficient to maintain him in his
normal state as a labouring individual. His natural wants, such as food,
clothing, fuel, and housing, vary according to the climatic and other physical
conditions of his country. On the other hand, the number and extent of his
so-called necessary wants, as also the modes of satisfying them, are themselves
the product of historical development, and depend therefore to a great extent
on the degree of civilisation of a country, more particularly on the conditions
under which, and consequently on the habits and degree of comfort in which, the
class of free labourers has been formed.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn175" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref175"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a>
In contradistinction therefore to the case of other commodities, there enters
into the determination of the value of labour-power a historical and moral
element. Nevertheless, in a given country, at a given period, the average
quantity of the means of subsistence necessary for the labourer is practically
known. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The owner
of labour-power is mortal. If then his appearance in the market is to be
continuous, and the continuous conversion of money into capital assumes this,
the seller of labour-power must perpetuate himself, “in the way that every
living individual perpetuates himself, by procreation.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn176" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref176"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a> The labour-power withdrawn from the market
by wear and tear and death, must be continually replaced by, at the very least,
an equal amount of fresh labour-power. Hence the sum of the means of
subsistence necessary for the production of labour-power must include the means
necessary for the labourer’s substitutes, i.e., his children, in order that
this race of peculiar commodity-owners may perpetuate its appearance in the
market.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn177" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref177"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In order to
modify the human organism, so that it may acquire skill and handiness in a
given branch of industry, and become labour-power of a special kind, a special
education or training is requisite, and this, on its part, costs an equivalent
in commodities of a greater or less amount. This amount varies according to the
more or less complicated character of the labour-power. The expenses of this
education (excessively small in the case of ordinary labour-power), enter pro
tanto into the total value spent in its production. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The value
of labour-power resolves itself into the value of a definite quantity of the
means of subsistence. It therefore varies with the value of these means or with
the quantity of labour requisite for their production. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some of the
means of subsistence, such as food and fuel, are consumed daily, and a fresh
supply must be provided daily. Others such as clothes and furniture last for
longer periods and require to be replaced only at longer intervals. One article
must be bought or paid for daily, another weekly, another quarterly, and so on.
But in whatever way the sum total of these outlays may be spread over the year,
they must be covered by the average income, taking one day with another. If the
total of the commodities required daily for the production of labour-power = A,
and those required weekly = B, and those required quarterly = C, and so on, the
daily average of these commodities = (365A + 52B + 4C + &amp;c) / 365. Suppose
that in this mass of commodities requisite for the average day there are
embodied 6 hours of social labour, then there is incorporated daily in labour-power
half a day’s average social labour, in other words, half a day’s labour is
requisite for the daily production of labour-power. This quantity of labour
forms the value of a day’s labour-power or the value of the labour-power daily
reproduced. If half a day’s average social labour is incorporated in three
shillings, then three shillings is the price corresponding to the value of a
day’s labour-power. If its owner therefore offers it for sale at three
shillings a day, its selling price is equal to its value, and according to our
supposition, our friend Moneybags, who is intent upon converting his three
shillings into capital, pays this value. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The minimum
limit of the value of labour-power is determined by the value of the
commodities, without the daily supply of which the labourer cannot renew his
vital energy, consequently by the value of those means of subsistence that are
physically indispensable. If the price of labour-power fall to this minimum, it
falls below its value, since under such circumstances it can be maintained and
developed only in a crippled state. But the value of every commodity is
determined by the labour-time requisite to turn it out so as to be of normal
quality. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is a
very cheap sort of sentimentality which declares this method of determining the
value of labour-power, a method prescribed by the very nature of the case, to
be a brutal method, and which wails with Rossi that, “To comprehend capacity
for labour (puissance de travail) at the same time that we make abstraction from
the means of subsistence of the labourers during the process of production, is
to comprehend a phantom (être de raison). When we speak of labour, or capacity
for labour, we speak at the same time of the labourer and his means of
subsistence, of labourer and wages.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn178" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref178"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a>
When we speak of capacity for labour, we do not speak of labour, any more than
when we speak of capacity for digestion, we speak of digestion. The latter
process requires something more than a good stomach. When we speak of capacity
for labour, we do not abstract from the necessary means of subsistence. On the
contrary, their value is expressed in its value. If his capacity for labour
remains unsold, the labourer derives no benefit from it, but rather he will
feel it to be a cruel nature-imposed necessity that this capacity has cost for
its production a definite amount of the means of subsistence and that it will
continue to do so for its reproduction. He will then agree with Sismondi: “that
capacity for labour ... is nothing unless it is sold.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn179" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref179"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One
consequence of the peculiar nature of labour-power as a commodity is, that its
use-value does not, on the conclusion of the contract between the buyer and
seller, immediately pass into the hands of the former. Its value, like that of
every other commodity, is already fixed before it goes into circulation, since
a definite quantity of social labour has been spent upon it; but its use-value
consists in the subsequent exercise of its force. The alienation of
labour-power and its actual appropriation by the buyer, its employment as a
use-value, are separated by an interval of time. But in those cases in which
the formal alienation by sale of the use-value of a commodity, is not
simultaneous with its actual delivery to the buyer, the money of the latter
usually functions as means of payment.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn180" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref180"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a>
In every country in which the capitalist mode of production reigns, it is the
custom not to pay for labour-power before it has been exercised for the period
fixed by the contract, as for example, the end of each week. In all cases,
therefore, the use-value of the labour-power is advanced to the capitalist: the
labourer allows the buyer to consume it before he receives payment of the
price; he everywhere gives credit to the capitalist. That this credit is no
mere fiction, is shown not only by the occasional loss of wages on the
bankruptcy of the capitalist,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn181" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref181"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">13</span></a> but also
by a series of more enduring consequences.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_054.htm#_edn182" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref182"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">14</span></a>
Nevertheless, whether money serves as a means of purchase or as a means of
payment, this makes no alteration in the nature of the exchange of commodities.
The price of the labour-power is fixed by the contract, although it is not
realised till later, like the rent of a house. The labour-power is sold,
although it is only paid for at a later period. It will, therefore, be useful,
for a clear comprehension of the relation of the parties, to assume
provisionally, that the possessor of labour-power, on the occasion of each
sale, immediately receives the price stipulated to be paid for it. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We now know
how the value paid by the purchaser to the possessor of this peculiar
commodity, labour-power, is determined. The use-value which the former gets in
exchange, manifests itself only in the actual utilisation, in the consumption
of the labour-power. The money-owner buys everything necessary for this
purpose, such as raw material, in the market, and pays for it at its full
value. The consumption of labour-power is at one and the same time the
production of commodities and of surplus-value. The consumption of labour-power
is completed, as in the case of every other commodity, outside the limits of
the market or of the sphere of circulation. Accompanied by Mr. Moneybags and by
the possessor of labour-power, we therefore take leave for a time of this noisy
sphere, where everything takes place on the surface and in view of all men, and
follow them both into the hidden abode of production, on whose threshold there
stares us in the face “No admittance except on business.” Here we shall see,
not only how capital produces, but how capital is produced. We shall at last
force the secret of profit making. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This sphere
that we are deserting, within whose boundaries the sale and purchase of
labour-power goes on, is in fact a very Eden of the innate rights of man. There
alone rule Freedom, Equality, Property and Bentham. Freedom, because both buyer
and seller of a commodity, say of labour-power, are constrained only by their
own free will. They contract as free agents, and the agreement they come to, is
but the form in which they give legal expression to their common will.
Equality, because each enters into relation with the other, as with a simple
owner of commodities, and they exchange equivalent for equivalent. Property,
because each disposes only of what is his own. And Bentham, because each looks
only to himself. The only force that brings them together and puts them in
relation with each other, is the selfishness, the gain and the private
