<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">That portion of the working day which merely
produces an equivalent for the value paid by the capitalist for his
labour-power, has, up to this point, been treated by us as a constant
magnitude, and such in fact it is, under given conditions of production and at
a given stage in the economic development of society. Beyond this, his
necessary labour-time, the labourer, we saw, could continue to work for 2, 3,
4, 6, &amp;c., hours. The rate of surplus-value and the length of the working
day depended on the magnitude of this prolongation. Though the necessary
labour-time was constant, we saw, on the other hand, that the total working day
was variable. Now suppose we have a working day whose length, and whose
apportionment between necessary labour and surplus labour, are given. Let the
whole line a c, a–b–c represent, for example, a working day of 12 hours; the
portion of a b 10 hours of necessary labour, and the portion b c 2 hours of
surplus labour. How now can the production of surplus-value be increased, i.e.,
how can the surplus labour be prolonged, without, or independently of, any
prolongation of a c? </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although the length of a c is given, b c appears
to be capable of prolongation, if not by extension beyond its end c, which is
also the end of the working day a c, yet, at all events, by pushing back its
starting-point b in the direction of a. Assume that b'–b in the line ab'bc is
equal to half of b c </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN-GB">a–––b'–b––c</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">or to one hour’s labour-time. If now, in a c,
the working day of 12 hours, we move the point b to b', b c becomes b' c; the
surplus labour increases by one half, from 2 hours to 3 hours, although the
working day remains as before at 12 hours. This extension of the surplus
labour-time from b c to b' c, from 2 hours to 3 hours, is, however, evidently
impossible, without a simultaneous contraction of the necessary labour-time
from a b into a b', from 10 hours to 9 hours. The prolongation of the surplus
labour would correspond to a shortening of the necessary labour; or a portion
of the labour-time previously consumed, in reality, for the labourer’s own
benefit, would be converted into labour-time for the benefit of the capitalist.
There would be an alteration, not in the length of the working day, but in its
division into necessary labour-time and surplus labour-time. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the other hand, it is evident that the
duration of the surplus labour is given, when the length of the working day,
and the value of labour-power, are given. The value of labour-power, i.e., the
labour-time requisite to produce labour-power, determines the labour-time
necessary for the reproduction of that value. If one working-hour be embodied
in sixpence, and the value of a day’s labour-power be five shillings, the
labourer must work 10 hours a day, in order to replace the value paid by
capital for his labour-power, or to produce an equivalent for the value of his
daily necessary means of subsistence. Given the value of these means of
subsistence, the value of his labour-power is given;<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn397" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref397"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> and given the value of his labour-power,
the duration of his necessary labour-time is given. The duration of the surplus
labour, however, is arrived at, by subtracting the necessary labour-time from
the total working day. Ten hours subtracted from twelve, leave two, and it is
not easy to see, how, under the given conditions, the surplus labour can
possibly be prolonged beyond two hours. No doubt, the capitalist can, instead
of five shillings, pay the labourer four shillings and sixpence or even less.
For the reproduction of this value of four shillings and sixpence, nine hours’
labour-time would suffice; and consequently three hours of surplus labour,
instead of two, would accrue to the capitalist, and the surplus-value would
rise from one shilling to eighteen-pence. This result, however, would be
obtained only by lowering the wages of the labourer below the value of his
labour-power. With the four shillings and sixpence which he produces in nine
hours, he commands one-tenth less of the necessaries of life than before, and
consequently the proper reproduction of his labour-power is crippled. The
surplus labour would in this case be prolonged only by an overstepping of its
normal limits; its domain would be extended only by a usurpation of part of the
domain of necessary labour-time. Despite the important part which this method
plays in actual practice, we are excluded from considering it in this place, by
our assumption, that all commodities, including labour-power, are bought and
sold at their full value. Granted this, it follows that the labour-time
necessary for the production of labour-power, or for the reproduction of its
value, cannot be lessened by a fall in the labourer’s wages below the value of
his labour-power, but only by a fall in this value itself. Given the length of
the working day, the prolongation of the surplus labour must of necessity
originate in the curtailment of the necessary labour-time; the latter cannot
arise from the former. In the example we have taken, it is necessary that the
value of labour-power should actually fall by one-tenth, in order that the
necessary labour-time may be diminished by one-tenth, i.e., from ten hours to
nine, and in order that the surplus labour may consequently be prolonged from
two hours to three. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Such a fall in the value of labour-power
implies, however, that the same necessaries of life which were formerly
produced in ten hours, can now be produced in nine hours. But this is
impossible without an increase in the productiveness of labour. For example,
suppose a shoe-maker, with given tools, makes in one working day of twelve
hours, one pair of boots. If he must make two pairs in the same time, the
productiveness of his labour must be doubled; and this cannot be done, except
by an alteration in his tools or in his mode of working, or in both. Hence, the
conditions of production, i.e., his mode of production, and the labour-process
itself, must be revolutionised. By increase in the productiveness of labour, we
mean, generally, an alteration in the labour-process, of such a kind as to
shorten the labour-time socially necessary for the production of a commodity,
and to endow a given quantity of labour with the power of producing a greater
quantity of use-value.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn398" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref398"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a> Hitherto
in treating of surplus-value, arising from a simple prolongation of the working
day, we have assumed the mode of production to be given and invariable. But
when surplus-value has to be produced by the conversion of necessary labour
into surplus labour, it by no means suffices for capital to take over the
labour-process in the form under which it has been historically handed down,
and then simply to prolong the duration of that process. The technical and
social conditions of the process, and consequently the very mode of production
must be revolutionised, before the productiveness of labour can be increased.
By that means alone can the value of labour-power be made to sink, and the
portion of the working day necessary for the reproduction of that value, be
shortened. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The surplus-value produced by prolongation of
the working day, I call <i class="calibre4">absolute surplus-value</i>. On the other hand, the surplus-value
arising from the curtailment of the necessary labour-time, and from the
corresponding alteration in the respective lengths of the two components of the
working day, I call <i class="calibre4">relative surplus-value</i>. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In order to effect a fall in the value of
labour-power, the increase in the productiveness of labour must seize upon
those branches of industry whose products determine the value of labour-power,
and consequently either belong to the class of customary means of subsistence,
or are capable of supplying the place of those means. But the value of a
commodity is determined, not only by the quantity of labour which the labourer
directly bestows upon that commodity, but also by the labour contained in the
means of production. For instance, the value of a pair of boots depends not
only on the cobbler’s labour, but also on the value of the leather, wax,
thread, &amp;c. Hence, a fall in the value of labour-power is also brought
about by an increase in the productiveness of labour, and by a corresponding
cheapening of commodities in those industries which supply the instruments of
labour and the raw material, that form the material elements of the constant
capital required for producing the necessaries of life. But an increase in the
productiveness of labour in those branches of industry which supply neither the
necessaries of life, nor the means of production for such necessaries, leaves
the value of labour-power undisturbed. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The cheapened commodity, of course, causes only
a pro tanto fall in the value of labour-power, a fall proportional to the
extent of that commodity’s employment in the reproduction of labour-power.
Shirts, for instance, are a necessary means of subsistence, but are only one
out of many. The totality of the necessaries of life consists, however, of
various commodities, each the product of a distinct industry; and the value of
each of those commodities enters as a component part into the value of
labour-power. This latter value decreases with the decrease of the labour-time
necessary for its reproduction; the total decrease being the sum of all the
different curtailments of labour-time effected in those various and distinct
industries. This general result is treated, here, as if it were the immediate
result directly aimed at in each individual case. Whenever an individual
capitalist cheapens shirts, for instance, by increasing the productiveness of
labour he by no means necessarily aims at reducing the value of labour-power
and shortening, pro tanto the necessary labour-time. But it is only in so far
as he ultimately contributes to this result, that he assists in raising the
general rate of surplus-value.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn399" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref399"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a> The general
and necessary tendencies of capital must be distinguished from their forms of
manifestation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is not our intention to consider, here, the
way in which the laws, immanent in capitalist production, manifest themselves
in the movements of individual masses of capital, where they assert themselves
as coercive laws of competition, and are brought home to the mind and
consciousness of the individual capitalist as the directing motives of his
operations. But this much is clear; a scientific analysis of competition is not
possible, before we have a conception of the inner nature of capital, just as
the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are not intelligible to any but
him, who is acquainted with their real motions, motions which are not directly
perceptible by the senses. Nevertheless, for the better comprehension of the
production of relative surplus-value, we may add the following remarks, in
which we assume nothing more than the results we have already obtained. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If one hour’s labour is embodied in sixpence, a
value of six shillings will be produced in a working day of 12 hours. Suppose,
that with the prevailing productiveness of labour, 12 articles are produced in
these 12 hours. Let the value of the means of production used up in each
article be sixpence. Under these circumstances, each article costs one
shilling: sixpence for the value of the means of production, and sixpence for
the value newly added in working with those means. Now let some one capitalist
contrive to double the productiveness of labour, and to produce in the working
day of 12 hours, 24 instead of 12 such articles. The value of the means of
production remaining the same, the value of each article will fall to
ninepence, made up of sixpence for the value of the means of production and
threepence for the value newly added by the labour. Despite the doubled
productiveness of labour, the day’s labour creates, as before, a new value of
six shillings and no more, which, however, is now spread over twice as many
articles. Of this value each article now has embodied in it 1/24th, instead of
1/12th, threepence instead of sixpence; or, what amounts to the same thing,
only half an hour’s instead of a whole hour’s labour-time, is now added to the
means of production while they are being transformed into each article. The
individual value of these articles is now below their social value; in other
words, they have cost less labour-time than the great bulk of the same article
produced under the average social conditions. Each article costs, on an average,
one shilling, and represents 2 hours of social labour; but under the altered
mode of production it costs only ninepence, or contains only 1½ hours’ labour.
The real value of a commodity is, however, not its individual value, but its
social value; that is to say, the real value is not measured by the labour-time
that the article in each individual case costs the producer, but by the
labour-time socially required for its production. If therefore, the capitalist
who applies the new method, sells his commodity at its social value of one
shilling, he sells it for threepence above its individual value, and thus
realises an extra surplus-value of threepence. On the other hand, the working
day of 12 hours is, as regards him, now represented by 24 articles instead of
12. Hence, in order to get rid of the product of one working day, the demand
must be double what it was, i.e., the market must become twice as extensive.
Other things being equal, his commodities can command a more extended market
only by a diminution of their prices. He will therefore sell them above their
individual but under their social value, say at tenpence each. By this means he
still squeezes an extra surplus-value of one penny out of each. This
augmentation of surplus-value is pocketed by him, whether his commodities
belong or not to the class of necessary means of subsistence that participate
in determining the general value of labour-power. Hence, independently of this
latter circumstance, there is a motive for each individual capitalist to
cheapen his commodities, by increasing the productiveness of labour. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Nevertheless, even in this case, the increased
production of surplus-value arises from the curtailment of the necessary
labour-time, and from the corresponding prolongation of the surplus labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn400" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref400"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> Let the necessary labour-time amount to 10
hours, the value of a day’s labour-power to five shillings, the surplus
labour-time to 2 hours, and the daily surplus-value to one shilling. But the
capitalist now produces 24 articles, which he sells at tenpence a-piece, making
twenty shillings in all. Since the value of the means of production is twelve
shillings, 14 2/5 of these articles merely replace the constant capital
advanced. The labour of the 12 hours’ working day is represented by the remaining
9 3/5 articles. Since the price of the labour-power is five shillings, 6
articles represent the necessary labour-time, and 3 3/5 articles the surplus
labour. The ratio of the necessary labour to the surplus labour, which under
average social conditions was 5:1, is now only 5:3. The same result may be
arrived at in the following way. The value of the product of the working day of
12 hours is twenty shillings. Of this sum, twelve shillings belong to the value
of the means of production, a value that merely re-appears. There remain eight
shillings, which are the expression in money, of the value newly created during
the working day. This sum is greater than the sum in which average social
labour of the same kind is expressed: twelve hours of the latter labour are
expressed by six shillings only. The exceptionally productive labour operates
as intensified labour; it creates in equal periods of time greater values than
average social labour of the same kind. (See Ch. I. Sect 2. p. 44.) But our
capitalist still continues to pay as before only five shillings as the value of
a day’s labour-power. Hence, instead of 10 hours, the labourer need now work
only 7½ hours, in order to reproduce this value. His surplus labour is,
therefore, increased by 2½ hours, and the surplus-value he produces grows from
one, into three shillings. Hence, the capitalist who applies the improved
method of production, appropriates to surplus labour a greater portion of the
working day, than the other capitalists in the same trade. He does individually,
what the whole body of capitalists engaged in producing relative surplus-value,
do collectively. On the other hand, however, this extra surplus-value vanishes,
so soon as the new method of production has become general, and has
consequently caused the difference between the individual value of the
cheapened commodity and its social value to vanish. The law of the
determination of value by labour-time, a law which brings under its sway the
individual capitalist who applies the new method of production, by compelling
him to sell his goods under their social value, this same law, acting as a
coercive law of competition, forces his competitors to adopt the new method.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn401" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref401"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> The general rate of surplus-value is,
therefore, ultimately affected by the whole process, only when the increase in
the productiveness of labour, has seized upon those branches of production that
are connected with, and has cheapened those commodities that form part of, the
necessary means of subsistence, and are therefore elements of the value of
labour-power. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The value of commodities is in inverse ratio to
the productiveness of labour. And so, too, is the value of labour-power,
because it depends on the values of commodities. Relative surplus-value is, on
the contrary, directly proportional to that productiveness. It rises with
rising and falls with falling productiveness. The value of money being assumed
to be constant, an average social working day of 12 hours always produces the
same new value, six shillings, no matter how this sum may be apportioned
between surplus-value and wages. But if, in consequence of increased
productiveness, the value of the necessaries of life fall, and the value of a
day’s labour-power be thereby reduced from five shillings to three, the surplus-value
increases from one shilling to three. Ten hours were necessary for the
reproduction of the value of the labour-power; now only six are required. Four
hours have been set free, and can be annexed to the domain of surplus labour.
Hence there is immanent in capital an inclination and constant tendency, to
heighten the productiveness of labour, in order to cheapen commodities, and by
such cheapening to cheapen the labourer himself.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn402" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref402"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The value of a commodity is, in itself, of no
interest to the capitalist. What alone interests him, is the surplus-value that
dwells in it, and is realisable by sale. Realisation of the surplus-value
necessarily carries with it the refunding of the value that was advanced. Now,
since relative surplus-value increases in direct proportion to the development
of the productiveness of labour, while, on the other hand, the value of
commodities diminishes in the same proportion; since one and the same process
cheapens commodities, and augments the surplus-value contained in them; we have
here the solution of the riddle: why does the capitalist, whose sole concern is
the production of exchange-value, continually strive to depress the
exchange-value of commodities? A riddle with which Quesnay, one of the founders
of Political Economy, tormented his opponents, and to which they could give him
no answer.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“You acknowledge,” he says, “that the more
expenses and the cost of labour can, in the manufacture of industrial products,
be reduced without injury to production, the more advantageous is such reduction,
because it diminishes the price of the finished article. And yet, you believe
that the production of wealth, which arises from the labour of the workpeople,
consists in the augmentation of the exchange-value of their products.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn403" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref403"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The shortening of the working day is, therefore,
by no means what is aimed at, in capitalist production, when labour is
economised by increasing its productiveness.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn404" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref404"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a>
It is only the shortening of the labour-time, necessary for the production of a
definite quantity of commodities, that is aimed at. The fact that the workman,
when the productiveness of his labour has been increased, produces, say 10
times as many commodities as before, and thus spends one-tenth as much
labour-time on each, by no means prevents him from continuing to work 12 hours
as before, nor from producing in those 12 hours 1,200 articles instead of 120.
Nay, more, his working day may be prolonged at the same time, so as to make him
produce, say 1,400 articles in 14 hours. In the treatises, therefore, of economists
of the stamp of MacCulloch, Ure, Senior, and <i class="calibre4">tutti quanti</i> [the like], we
may read upon one page, that the labourer owes a debt of gratitude to capital
for developing his productiveness, because the necessary labour-time is thereby
shortened, and on the next page, that he must prove his gratitude by working in
future for 15 hours instead of 10. The object of all development of the
productiveness of labour, within the limits of capitalist production, is to
shorten that part of the working day, during which the workman must labour for
his own benefit, and by that very shortening, to lengthen the other part of the
day, during which he is at liberty to work gratis for the capitalist. How far
this result is also attainable, without cheapening commodities, will appear
from an examination of the particular modes of producing relative surplus-value,
to which examination we now proceed. </span></p>
