Origin of Manufacture</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">That
co-operation which is based on division of labour, assumes its typical form in
manufacture, and is the prevalent characteristic form of the capitalist process
of production throughout the manufacturing period properly so called. That
period, roughly speaking, extends from the middle of the 16th to the last third
of the 18th century. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Manufacture
takes its rise in two ways: </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">(1.) By the
assemblage, in one workshop under the control of a single capitalist, of
labourers belonging to various independent handicrafts, but through whose hands
a given article must pass on its way to completion. A carriage, for example,
was formerly the product of the labour of a great number of independent
artificers, such as wheelwrights, harness-makers, tailors, locksmiths,
upholsterers, turners, fringe-makers, glaziers, painters, polishers, gilders,
&amp;c. In the manufacture of carriages, however, all these different
artificers are assembled in one building where they work into one another’s hands.
It is true that a carriage cannot be gilt before it has been made. But if a
number of carriages are being made simultaneously, some may be in the hands of
the gilders while others are going through an earlier process. So far, we are
still in the domain of simple co-operation, which finds its materials ready to
hand in the shape of men and things. But very soon an important change takes
place. The tailor, the locksmith, and the other artificers, being now
exclusively occupied in carriage-making, each gradually loses, through want of
practice, the ability to carry on, to its full extent, his old handicraft. But,
on the other hand, his activity now confined in one groove, assumes the form
best adapted to the narrowed sphere of action. At first, carriage manufacture
is a combination of various independent handicrafts. By degrees, it becomes the
splitting up of carriage-making into its various detail processes, each of
which crystallises into the exclusive function of a particular workman, the
manufacture, as a whole, being carried on by the men in conjunction. In the
same way, cloth manufacture, as also a whole series of other manufactures,
arose by combining different handicrafts together under the control of a single
capitalist.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn427" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref427"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">(2.)
Manufacture also arises in a way exactly the reverse of this - namely, by
one capitalist employing simultaneously in one workshop a number of artificers,
who all do the same, or the same kind of work, such as making paper, type, or
needles. This is co-operation in its most elementary form. Each of these
artificers (with the help, perhaps, of one or two apprentices), makes the
entire commodity, and he consequently performs in succession all the operations
necessary for its production. He still works in his old handicraft-like way. But
very soon external circumstances cause a different use to be made of the
concentration of the workmen on one spot, and of the simultaneousness of their
work. An increased quantity of the article has perhaps to be delivered within a
given time. The work is therefore re-distributed. Instead of each man being
allowed to perform all the various operations in succession, these operations
are changed into disconnected, isolated ones, carried on side by side; each is
assigned to a different artificer, and the whole of them together are performed
simultaneously by the co-operating workmen. This accidental repartition gets
repeated, develops advantages of its own, and gradually ossifies into a
systematic division of labour. The commodity, from being the individual product
of an independent artificer, becomes the social product of a union of
artificers, each of whom performs one, and only one, of the constituent partial
operations. The same operations which, in the case of a papermaker belonging to
a German Guild, merged one into the other as the successive acts of one
artificer, became in the Dutch paper manufacture so many partial operations
carried on side by side by numerous co-operating labourers. The needlemaker of
the Nuremberg Guild was the cornerstone on which the English needle manufacture
was raised. But while in Nuremberg that single artificer performed a series of
perhaps 20 operations one after another, in England it was not long before
there were 20 needlemakers side by side, each performing one alone of those 20
operations, and in consequence of further experience, each of those 20
operations was again split up, isolated, and made the exclusive function of a
separate workman. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The mode in
which manufacture arises, its growth out of handicrafts, is therefore two-fold.
On the one hand, it arises from the union of various independent handicrafts,
which become stripped of their independence and specialised to such an extent
as to be reduced to mere supplementary partial processes in the production of
one particular commodity. On the other hand, it arises from the co-operation of
artificers of one handicraft; it splits up that particular handicraft into its
various detail operations, isolating, and making these operations independent
of one another up to the point where each becomes the exclusive function of a
particular labourer. On the one hand, therefore, manufacture either introduces
division of labour into a process of production, or further develops that
division; on the other hand, it unites together handicrafts that were formerly
separate. But whatever may have been its particular starting-point, its final
form is invariably the same - a productive mechanism whose parts are
human beings. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For a
proper understanding of the division of labour in manufacture, it is essential
that the following points be firmly grasped. First, the decomposition of a
process of production into its various successive steps coincides, here,
strictly with the resolution of a handicraft into its successive manual
operations. Whether complex or simple, each operation has to be done by hand,
retains the character of a handicraft, and is therefore dependent on the
strength, skill, quickness, and sureness, of the individual workman in handling
his tools. The handicraft continues to be the basis. This narrow technical
basis excludes a really scientific analysis of any definite process of
industrial production, since it is still a condition that each detail process
gone through by the product must be capable of being done by hand and of forming,
in its way, a separate handicraft. It is just because handicraft skill
continues, in this way, to be the foundation of the process of production, that
each workman becomes exclusively assigned to a partial function, and that for
the rest of his life, his labour-power is turned into the organ of this detail
function. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Secondly,
this division of labour is a particular sort of co-operation, and many of its
disadvantages spring from the general character of co-operation, and not from
this particular form of it. </span></p>

<h3 class="calibre23"><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="_Toc273516433"></a><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="__RefHeading__742_1418669237"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre20"></span><span class="calibre20"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">Section 2: The
Detail Labourer and his Implements</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If we now go more into detail, it is, in the
first place, clear that a labourer who all his life performs one and the same
simple operation, converts his whole body into the automatic, specialised implement
of that operation. Consequently, he takes less time in doing it, than the
artificer who performs a whole series of operations in succession. But the
collective labourer, who constitutes the living mechanism of manufacture, is
made up solely of such specialised detail labourers. Hence, in comparison with
the independent handicraft, more is produced in a given time, or the productive
power of labour is increased.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn428" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref428"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a> Moreover,
when once this fractional work is established as the exclusive function of one
person, the methods it employs become perfected. The workman’s continued
repetition of the same simple act, and the concentration of his attention on
it, teach him by experience how to attain the desired effect with the minimum
of exertion. But since there are always several generations of labourers living
at one time, and working together at the manufacture of a given article, the
technical skill, the tricks of the trade thus acquired, become established, and
are accumulated and handed down.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn429" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref429"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Manufacture, in fact, produces the skill of the
detail labourer, by reproducing, and systematically driving to an extreme
within the workshop, the naturally developed differentiation of trades which it
found ready to hand in society at large. On the other hand, the conversion of
fractional work into the life-calling of one man, corresponds to the tendency
shown by earlier societies, to make trades hereditary; either to petrify them
into castes, or whenever definite historical conditions beget in the individual
a tendency to vary in a manner incompatible with the nature of castes, to
ossify them into guilds. Castes and guilds arise from the action of the same
natural law, that regulates the differentiation of plants and animals into
species and varieties, except that, when a certain degree of development has
been reached, the heredity of castes and the exclusiveness of guilds are
ordained as a law of society.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn430" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref430"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The muslins
of Dakka in fineness, the calicoes and other piece goods of Coromandel in
brilliant and durable colours, have never been surpassed. Yet they are produced
without capital, machinery, division of labour, or any of those means which
give such facilities to the manufacturing interest of Europe. The weaver is
merely a detached individual, working a web when ordered of a customer, and
with a loom of the rudest construction, consisting sometimes of a few branches
or bars of wood, put roughly together. There is even no expedient for rolling
up the warp; the loom must therefore be kept stretched to its full length, and
becomes so inconveniently large, that it cannot be contained within the hut of
the manufacturer, who is therefore compelled to ply his trade in the open air,
where it is interrupted by every vicissitude of the weather.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn431" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref431"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is only
the special skill accumulated from generation to generation, and transmitted
from father to son, that gives to the Hindu, as it does to the spider, this
proficiency. And yet the work of such a Hindu weaver is very complicated,
compared with that of a manufacturing labourer. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An
artificer, who performs one after another the various fractional operations in
the production of a finished article, must at one time change his place, at
another his tools. The transition from one operation to another interrupts the
flow of his labour, and creates, so to say, gaps in his working day. These gaps
close up so soon as he is tied to one and the same operation all day long; they
vanish in proportion as the changes in his work diminish. The resulting
increased productive power is owing either to an increased expenditure of
labour-power in a given time i.e., to increased intensity of labour or to a
decrease in the amount of labour-power unproductively consumed. The extra
expenditure of power, demanded by every transition from rest to motion, is made
up for by prolonging the duration of the normal velocity when once acquired. On
the other hand, constant labour of one uniform kind disturbs the intensity and
flow of a man’s animal spirits, which find recreation and delight in mere
change of activity. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
productiveness of labour depends not only on the proficiency of the workman,
but on the perfection of his tools. Tools of the same kind, such as knives,
drills, gimlets, hammers, &amp;c., may be employed in different processes; and
the same tool may serve various purposes in a single process. But so soon as
the different operations of a labour-process are disconnected the one from the
other, and each fractional operation acquires in the hands of the detail
labourer a suitable and peculiar form, alterations become necessary in the
implements that previously served more than one purpose. The direction taken by
this change is determined by the difficulties experienced in consequence of the
unchanged form of the implement. Manufacture is characterised by the
differentiation of the instruments of labour - a differentiation whereby
implements of a given sort acquire fixed shapes, adapted to each particular
application, and by the specialisation of those instruments, giving to each
special implement its full play only in the hands of a specific detail
labourer. In Birmingham alone 500 varieties of hammers are produced, and not
only is each adapted to one particular process, but several varieties often
serve exclusively for the different operations in one and the same process. The
manufacturing period simplifies, improves, and multiplies the implements of
labour, by adapting them to the exclusively special functions of each detail
labourer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn432" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref432"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> It thus creates at the same
time one of the material conditions for the existence of machinery, which
consists of a combination of simple instruments. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The detail
labourer and his implements are the simplest elements of manufacture. Let us
now turn to its aspect as a whole. </span></p>

<h3 class="calibre23"><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="_Toc273516434"></a><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="__RefHeading__744_1418669237"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre20"></span><span class="calibre20"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">Section 3: The
Two Fundamental Forms of Manufacture: Heterogeneous Manufacture, Serial
Manufacture</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
organisation of manufacture has two fundamental forms which, in spite of
occasional blending, are essentially different in kind, and, moreover, play
very distinct parts in the subsequent transformation of manufacture into modern
industry carried on by machinery. This double character arises from the nature
of the article produced. This article either results from the mere mechanical
fitting together of partial products made independently, or owes its completed
shape to a series of connected processes and manipulations. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A
locomotive, for instance, consists of more than 5,000 independent parts. It
cannot, however, serve as an example of the first kind of genuine manufacture,
for it is a structure produced by modern mechanical industry. But a watch can;
and William Petty used it to illustrate the division of labour in manufacture.
Formerly the individual work of a Nuremberg artificer, the watch has been
transformed into the social product of an immense number of detail labourers,
such as mainspring makers, dial makers, spiral spring makers, jewelled hole
makers, ruby lever makers, hand makers, case makers, screw makers, gilders,
with numerous subdivisions, such as wheel makers (brass and steel separate), pin
makers, movement makers, acheveur de pignon (fixes the wheels on the axles,
polishes the facets, &amp;c.), pivot makers, planteur de finissage (puts the
wheels and springs in the works), finisseur de barillet (cuts teeth in the
wheels, makes the holes of the right size, &amp;c.), escapement makers,
cylinder makers for cylinder escapements, escapement wheel makers, balance
wheel makers, raquette makers (apparatus for regulating the watch), the
planteur d’échappement (escapement maker proper); then the repasseur de barillet
(finishes the box for the spring, &amp;c.), steel polishers, wheel polishers,
screw polishers, figure painters, dial enamellers (melt the enamel on the
copper), fabricant de pendants (makes the ring by which the case is hung),
finisseur de charnière (puts the brass hinge in the cover, &amp;c.), faiseur de
secret (puts in the springs that open the case), graveur, ciseleur, polisseur
de boîte, &amp;c., &amp;c., and last of all the repasseur, who fits together
the whole watch and hands it over in a going state. Only a few parts of the
watch pass through several hands; and all these membra disjecta come together
for the first time in the hand that binds them into one mechanical whole. This
external relation between the finished product, and its various and diverse elements
makes it, as well in this case as in the case of all similar finished articles,
a matter of chance whether the detail labourers are brought together in one
workshop or not. The detail operations may further be carried on like so many
independent handicrafts, as they are in the Cantons of Vaud and Neufchâtel;
while in Geneva there exist large watch manufactories where the detail
labourers directly co-operate under the control of a single capitalist. And
even in the latter case the dial, the springs, and the case, are seldom made in
the factory itself. To carry on the trade as a manufacture, with concentration
of workmen, is, in the watch trade, profitable only under exceptional
conditions, because competition is greater between the labourers who desire to
work at home, and because the splitting up of the work into a number of
heterogeneous processes, permits but little use of the instruments of labour in
common, and the capitalist, by scattering the work, saves the outlay on
workshops, &amp;c.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn433" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref433"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a>
Nevertheless the position of this detail labourer who, though he works at home,
does so for a capitalist (manufacturer, établisseur), is very different from
that of the independent artificer, who works for his own customers.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn434" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref434"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The second
kind of manufacture, its perfected form, produces articles that go through
connected phases of development, through a series of processes step by step,
like the wire in the manufacture of needles, which passes through the hands of
72 and sometimes even 92 different detail workmen. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In so far
as such a manufacture, when first started, combines scattered handicrafts, it
lessens the space by which the various phases of production are separated from
each other. The time taken in passing from one stage to another is shortened,
so is the labour that effectuates this passage.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn435" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref435"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a>
In comparison with a handicraft, productive power is gained, and this gain is
owing to the general co-operative character of manufacture. On the other hand,
division of labour, which is the distinguishing principle of manufacture,
requires the isolation of the various stages of production and their
independence of each other. The establishment and maintenance of a connexion
between the isolated functions necessitates the incessant transport of the
article from one hand to another, and from one process to another. From the
standpoint of modern mechanical industry, this necessity stands forth as a
characteristic and costly disadvantage, and one that is immanent in the
principle of manufacture.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn436" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref436"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If we
confine our attention to some particular lot of raw materials, of rags, for
instance, in paper manufacture, or of wire in needle manufacture, we perceive
that it passes in succession through a series of stages in the hands of the
various detail workmen until completion. On the other hand, if we look at the
workshop as a whole, we see the raw material in all the stages of its
production at the same time. The collective labourer, with one set of his many
hands armed with one kind of tools, draws the wire, with another set, armed
with different tools, he, at the same time, straightens it, with another, he
cuts it, with another, points it, and so on. The different detail processes,
which were successive in time, have become simultaneous, go on side by side in
space. Hence, production of a greater quantum of finished commodities in a
given time.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn437" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref437"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a> This simultaneity, it is
true, is due to the general co-operative form of the process as a whole; but
Manufacture not only finds the conditions for co-operation ready to hand, it
also, to some extent, creates them by the sub-division of handicraft labour. On
the other hand, it accomplishes this social organisation of the labour-process
only by riveting each labourer to a single fractional detail. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Since the
fractional product of each detail labourer is, at the same time, only a
particular stage in the development of one and the same finished article, each
labourer, or each group of labourers, prepares the raw material for another
labourer or group. The result of the labour of the one is the starting-point
for the labour of the other. The one workman therefore gives occupation
directly to the other. The labour-time necessary in each partial process, for
attaining the desired effect, is learnt by experience; and the mechanism of
Manufacture, as a whole, is based on the assumption that a given result will be
obtained in a given time. It is only on this assumption that the various
supplementary labour-processes can proceed uninterruptedly, simultaneously, and
side by side. It is clear that this direct dependence of the operations, and
therefore of the labourers, on each other, compels each one of them to spend on
his work no more than the necessary time, and thus a continuity, uniformity,
regularity, order,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn438" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref438"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a> and even
intensity of labour, of quite a different kind, is begotten than is to be found
in an independent handicraft or even in simple co-operation. The rule, that the
labour-time expended on a commodity should not exceed that which is socially
necessary for its production, appears, in the production of commodities
generally, to be established by the mere effect of competition; since, to
express ourselves superficially, each single producer is obliged to sell his
commodity at its market-price. In Manufacture, on the contrary, the turning out
of a given quantum of product in a given time is a technical law of the process
of production itself.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn439" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref439"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">13</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Different
operations take, however, unequal periods, and yield therefore, in equal times
unequal quantities of fractional products. If, therefore, the same labourer
has, day after day, to perform the same operation, there must be a different
number of labourers for each operation; for instance, in type manufacture,
there are four founders and two breakers to one rubber: the founder casts 2,000
type an hour, the breaker breaks up 4,000, and the rubber polishes 8,000. Here
we have again the principle of co-operation in its simplest form, the
simultaneous employment of many doing the same thing; only now, this principle
is the expression of an organic relation. The division of labour, as carried
out in Manufacture, not only simplifies and multiplies the qualitatively
different parts of the social collective labourer, but also creates a fixed
mathematical relation or ratio which regulates the quantitative extent of those
parts i.e., the relative number of labourers, or the relative size of the group
of labourers, for each detail operation. It develops, along with the
qualitative sub-division of the social labour-process, a quantitative rule and
proportionality for that process. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When once
the most fitting proportion has been experimentally established for the numbers
of the detail labourers in the various groups when producing on a given scale,
that scale can be extended only by employing a multiple of each particular group.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn440" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref440"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">14</span></a> There is this to boot, that the same
individual can do certain kinds of work just as well on a large as on a small
scale; for instance, the labour of superintendence, the carriage of the
fractional product from one stage to the next, &amp;c. The isolation of such
functions, their allotment to a particular labourer, does not become
advantageous till after an increase in the number of labourers employed; but
this increase must affect every group proportionally. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
isolated group of labourers to whom any particular detail function is assigned,
is made up of homogeneous elements, and is one of the constituent parts of the
total mechanism. In many manufactures, however, the group itself is an
organised body of labour, the total mechanism being a repetition or
multiplication of these elementary organisms. Take, for instance, the
manufacture of glass bottles. It may be resolved into three essentially
different stages. First, the preliminary stage, consisting of the preparation
of the components of the glass, mixing the sand and lime, &amp;c., and melting
them into a fluid mass of glass.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn441" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref441"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">15</span></a> Various
detail labourers are employed in this first stage, as also in the final one of
removing the bottles from the drying furnace, sorting and packing them, &amp;c.
In the middle, between these two stages, comes the glass melting proper, the
manipulation of the fluid mass. At each mouth of the furnace, there works a
group, called “the hole,” consisting of one bottlemaker or finisher, one
blower, one gatherer, one putter-up or whetter-off, and one taker-in. These
five detail workers are so many special organs of a single working organism
that acts only as a whole, and therefore can operate only by the direct
co-operation of the whole five. The whole body is paralysed if but one of its members
be wanting. But a glass furnace has several openings (in England from 4 to 6),
each of which contains an earthenware melting-pot full of molten glass, and
employs a similar five-membered group of workers. The organisation of each
group is based on division of labour, but the bond between the different groups
is simple co-operation, which, by using in common one of the means of
production, the furnace, causes it to be more economically consumed. Such a
furnace, with its 4-6 groups, constitutes a glass house; and a glass
manufactory comprises a number of such glass houses, together with the
apparatus and workmen requisite for the preparatory and final stages. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Finally,
just as Manufacture arises in part from the combination of various handicrafts,
so, too, it develops into a combination of various manufactures. The larger
English glass manufacturers, for instance, make their own earthenware
melting-pots, because, on the quality of these depends, to a great extent, the
success or failure of the process. The manufacture of one of the means of
production is here united with that of the product. On the other hand, the
manufacture of the product may be united with other manufactures, of which that
product is the raw material, or with the products of which it is itself
subsequently mixed. Thus, we find the manufacture of flint glass combined with
that of glass cutting and brass founding; the latter for the metal settings of
various articles of glass. The various manufactures so combined form more or
less separate departments of a larger manufacture, but are at the same time
independent processes, each with its own division of labour. In spite of the
many advantages offered by this combination of manufactures, it never grows
into a complete technical system on its own foundation. That happens only on
its transformation into an industry carried on by machinery. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Early in
the manufacturing period, the principle of lessening the necessary labour-time
in the production of commodities<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn442" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref442"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">16</span></a>, was
accepted and formulated: and the use of machines, especially for certain simple
first processes that have to be conducted on a very large scale, and with the
application of great force, sprang up here and there. Thus, at an early period
in paper manufacture, the tearing up of the rags was done by paper-mills; and
in metal works, the pounding of the ores was effected by stamping mills.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn443" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref443"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">17</span></a> The Roman Empire had handed down the
elementary form of all machinery in the water-wheel.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn444" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref444"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">18</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
handicraft period bequeathed to us the great inventions of the compass, of
gunpowder, of type-printing, and of the automatic clock. But, on the whole,
machinery played that subordinate part which Adam Smith assigns to it in
comparison with division of labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn445" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref445"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">19</span></a>
The sporadic use of machinery in the 17th century was of the greatest
importance, because it supplied the great mathematicians of that time with a
practical basis and stimulant to the creation of the science of mechanics. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
collective labourer, formed by the combination of a number of detail labourers,
is the machinery specially characteristic of the manufacturing period. The
various operations that are performed in turns by the producer of a commodity,
and coalesce one with another during the progress of production, lay claim to
him in various ways. In one operation he must exert more strength, in another
more skill, in another more attention; and the same individual does not possess
all these qualities in an equal degree. After Manufacture has once separated,
made independent, and isolated the various operations, the labourers are
divided, classified, and grouped according to their predominating qualities. If
their natural endowments are, on the one hand, the foundation on which the
division of labour is built up, on the other hand, Manufacture, once introduced,
develops in them new powers that are by nature fitted only for limited and
special functions. The collective labourer now possesses, in an equal degree of
excellence, all the qualities requisite for production, and expends them in the
most economical manner, by exclusively employing all his organs, consisting of
particular labourers, or groups of labourers, in performing their special
functions.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn446" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref446"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">20</span></a> The one-sidedness and the
deficiencies of the detail labourer become perfections when he is a part of the
collective labourer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn447" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref447"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">21</span></a> The
habit of doing only one thing converts him into a never failing instrument,
while his connexion with the whole mechanism compels him to work with the
regularity of the parts of a machine.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn448" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref448"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">22</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Since the
collective labourer has functions, both simple and complex, both high and low,
his members, the individual labour-powers, require different degrees of
training, and must therefore have different values. Manufacture, therefore,
develops a hierarchy of labour-powers, to which there corresponds a scale of
wages. If, on the one hand, the individual labourers are appropriated and
annexed for life by a limited function; on the other hand, the various
operations of the hierarchy are parcelled out among the labourers according to
both their natural and their acquired capabilities.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn449" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref449"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">23</span></a> Every process of production, however,
requires certain simple manipulations, which every man is capable of doing.
They too are now severed from their connexion with the more pregnant moments of
activity, and ossified into exclusive functions of specially appointed
labourers. Hence, Manufacture begets, in every handicraft that it seizes upon,
a class of so-called unskilled labourers, a class which handicraft industry
strictly excluded. If it develops a one-sided speciality into a perfection, at
the expense of the whole of a man’s working capacity, it also begins to make a
speciality of the absence of all development. Alongside of the hierarchic
gradation there steps the simple separation of the labourers into skilled and
unskilled. For the latter, the cost of apprenticeship vanishes; for the former,
it diminishes, compared with that of artificers, in consequence of the
functions being simplified. In both cases the value of labour-power falls.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn450" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref450"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">24</span></a> An exception to this law holds good
whenever the decomposition of the labour-process begets new and comprehensive
functions, that either had no place at all, or only a very modest one, in
handicrafts. The fall in the value of labour-power, caused by the disappearance
or diminution of the expenses of apprenticeship, implies a direct increase of surplus-value
for the benefit of capital; for everything that shortens the necessary
labour-time required for the reproduction of labour-power, extends the domain
of surplus labour. </span></p>

Division of Labour in Manufacture, and Division of Labour in Society</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We first
considered the origin of Manufacture, then its simple elements, then the detail
labourer and his implements, and finally, the totality of the mechanism. We
shall now lightly touch upon the relation between the division of labour in
manufacture, and the social division of labour, which forms the foundation of
all production of commodities. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If we keep
labour alone in view, we may designate the separation of social production into
its main divisions or <em class="calibre4">genera</em> – viz., agriculture, industries, &amp;c.,
as division of labour in general, and the splitting up of these families into
species and sub-species, as division of labour in particular, and the division
of labour within the workshop as division of labour in singular or in detail.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn451" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref451"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">25</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Division of
labour in a society, and the corresponding tying down of individuals to a
particular calling, develops itself, just as does the division of labour in
manufacture, from opposite starting-points. Within a family,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn452" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref452"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">26</span></a> and after further development within a
tribe, there springs up naturally a division of labour, caused by differences
of sex and age, a division that is consequently based on a purely physiological
foundation, which division enlarges its materials by the expansion of the
community, by the increase of population, and more especially, by the conflicts
between different tribes, and the subjugation of one tribe by another. On the
other hand, as I have before remarked, the exchange of products springs up at
the points where different families, tribes, communities, come in contact; for,
in the beginning of civilisation, it is not private individuals but families,
tribes, &amp;c., that meet on an independent footing. Different communities find
different means of production, and different means of subsistence in their
natural environment. Hence, their modes of production, and of living, and their
products are different. It is this spontaneously developed difference which,
when different communities come in contact, calls forth the mutual exchange of
products, and the consequent gradual conversion of those products into
commodities. Exchange does not create the differences between the spheres of
production, but brings what are already different into relation, and thus
converts them into more or less inter-dependent branches of the collective
production of an enlarged society. In the latter case, the social division of
labour arises from the exchange between spheres of production, that are originally
distinct and independent of one another. In the former, where the physiological
division of labour is the starting-point, the particular organs of a compact
whole grow loose, and break off, principally owing to the exchange of
commodities with foreign communities, and then isolate themselves so far, that
the sole bond, still connecting the various kinds of work, is the exchange of
the products as commodities. In the one case, it is the making dependent what
was before independent; in the other case, the making independent what was
before dependent. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
foundation of every division of labour that is well developed, and brought
about by the exchange of commodities, is the separation between town and
country.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn453" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref453"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">27</span></a> It may be said, that the
whole economic history of society is summed up in the movement of this
antithesis. We pass it over, however, for the present. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Just as a
certain number of simultaneously employed labourers are the material
pre-requisites for division of labour in manufacture, so are the number and
density of the population, which here correspond to the agglomeration in one
workshop, a necessary condition for the division of labour in society.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn454" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref454"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">28</span></a> Nevertheless, this density is more or
less relative. A relatively thinly populated country, with well-developed means
of communication, has a denser population than a more numerously populated
country, with badly-developed means of communication; and in this sense the
Northern States of the American Union, for instance, are more thickly populated
than India.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn455" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref455"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">29</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Since the
production and the circulation of commodities are the general pre-requisites of
the capitalist mode of production, division of labour in manufacture demands,
that division of labour in society at large should previously have attained a
certain degree of development. Inversely, the former division reacts upon and
develops and multiplies the latter. Simultaneously, with the differentiation of
the instruments of labour, the industries that produce these instruments,
become more and more differentiated.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn456" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref456"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">30</span></a>
If the manufacturing system seize upon an industry, which, previously, was
carried on in connexion with others, either as a chief or as a subordinate
industry, and by one producer, these industries immediately separate their
connexion, and become independent. If it seize upon a particular stage in the
production of a commodity, the other stages of its production become converted
into so many independent industries. It has already been stated, that where the
finished article consists merely of a number of parts fitted together, the
detail operations may re-establish themselves as genuine and separate
handicrafts. In order to carry out more perfectly the division of labour in
manufacture, a single branch of production is, according to the varieties of
its raw material, or the various forms that one and the same raw material may
assume, split up into numerous, and to some extent, entirely new manufactures.
Accordingly, in France alone, in the first half of the 18th century, over 100
different kinds of silk stuffs were woven, and, in Avignon, it was law, that
“every apprentice should devote himself to only one sort of fabrication, and
should not learn the preparation of several kinds of stuff at once.” <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="31a"></a>The territorial division of labour, which confines special
branches of production to special districts of a country, acquires fresh
stimulus from the manufacturing system, which exploits every special advantage.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn457" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref457"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">31</span></a> The Colonial system and the opening out
of the markets of the world, both of which are included in the general
conditions of existence of the manufacturing period, furnish rich material for
developing the division of labour in society. It is not the place, here, to go
on to show how division of labour seizes upon, not only the economic, but every
other sphere of society, and everywhere lays the foundation of that all
engrossing system of specialising and sorting men, that development in a man of
one single faculty at the expense of all other faculties, which caused A.
Ferguson, the master of Adam Smith, to exclaim: “We make a nation of Helots,
and have no free citizens.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn458" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref458"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">32</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But, in
spite of the numerous analogies and links connecting them, division of labour
in the interior of a society, and that in the interior of a workshop, differ
not only in degree, but also in kind. The analogy appears most indisputable
where there is an invisible bond uniting the various branches of trade. For
instance the cattle-breeder produces hides, the tanner makes the hides into
leather, and the shoemaker, the leather into boots. Here the thing produced by
each of them is but a step towards the final form, which is the product of all
their labours combined. There are, besides, all the various industries that
supply the cattle-breeder, the tanner, and the shoemaker with the means of
production. Now it is quite possible to imagine, with Adam Smith, that the
difference between the above social division of labour, and the division in
manufacture, is merely subjective, exists merely for the observer, who, in a
manufacture, can see with one glance, all the numerous operations being
performed on one spot, while in the instance given above, the spreading out of
the work over great areas, and the great number of people employed in each
branch of labour, obscure the connexion.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn459" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref459"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">33</span></a>
But what is it that forms the bond between the independent labours of the
cattle-breeder, the tanner, and the shoemaker? It is the fact that their
respective products are commodities. What, on the other hand, characterises
division of labour in manufactures? The fact that the detail labourer produces
no commodities.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn460" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref460"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">34</span></a> It is
only the common product of all the detail labourers that becomes a commodity.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn461" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref461"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">35</span></a> Division of labour in society is brought
about by the purchase and sale of the products of different branches of
industry, while the connexion between the detail operations in a workshop, is
due to the sale of the labour-power of several workmen to one capitalist, who
applies it as combined labour-power. The division of labour in the workshop
implies concentration of the means of production in the hands of one
capitalist; the division of labour in society implies their dispersion among
many independent producers of commodities. While within the workshop, the iron
law of proportionality subjects definite numbers of workmen to definite
functions, in the society outside the workshop, chance and caprice have full
play in distributing the producers and their means of production among the
various branches of industry. The different spheres of production, it is true,
constantly tend to an equilibrium: for, on the one hand, while each producer of
a commodity is bound to produce a use-value, to satisfy a particular social
want, and while the extent of these wants differs quantitatively, still there
exists an inner relation which settles their proportions into a regular system,
and that system one of spontaneous growth; and, on the other hand, the law of
the value of commodities ultimately determines how much of its disposable
working-time society can expend on each particular class of commodities. But
this constant tendency to equilibrium, of the various spheres of production, is
exercised, only in the shape of a reaction against the constant upsetting of
this equilibrium. The <em class="calibre4">a priori</em> system on which the division of labour,
within the workshop, is regularly carried out, becomes in the division of
labour within the society, an <em class="calibre4">a posteriori</em>, nature-imposed necessity,
controlling the lawless caprice of the producers, and perceptible in the
barometrical fluctuations of the market-prices. Division of labour within the
workshop implies the undisputed authority of the capitalist over men, that are
but parts of a mechanism that belongs to him. The division of labour within the
society brings into contact independent commodity-producers, who acknowledge no
other authority but that of competition, of the coercion exerted by the
pressure of their mutual interests; just as in the animal kingdom, the <em class="calibre4">bellum
omnium contra omnes</em> <span>[war of all against all – Hobbes]</span>
more or less preserves the conditions of existence of every species. The same
bourgeois mind which praises division of labour in the workshop, life-long
annexation of the labourer to a partial operation, and his complete subjection
to capital, as being an organisation of labour that increases its
productiveness - that same bourgeois mind denounces with equal vigour
every conscious attempt to socially control and regulate the process of
production, as an inroad upon such sacred things as the rights of property,
freedom and unrestricted play for the bent of the individual capitalist. It is
very characteristic that the enthusiastic apologists of the factory system have
nothing more damning to urge against a general organisation of the labour of
society, than that it would turn all society into one immense factory. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If, in a
society with capitalist production, anarchy in the social division of labour
and despotism in that of the workshop are mutual conditions the one of the
other, we find, on the contrary, in those earlier forms of society in which the
separation of trades has been spontaneously developed, then crystallised, and
finally made permanent by law, on the one hand, a specimen of the organisation
of the labour of society, in accordance with an approved and authoritative
plan, and on the other, the entire exclusion of division of labour in the
workshop, or at all events a mere dwarflike or sporadic and accidental
development of the same.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn462" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref462"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">36</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Those small
and extremely ancient Indian communities, some of which have continued down to
this day, are based on possession in common of the land, on the blending of
agriculture and handicrafts, and on an unalterable division of labour, which
serves, whenever a new community is started, as a plan and scheme ready cut and
dried. Occupying areas of from 100 up to several thousand acres, each forms a
compact whole producing all it requires. The chief part of the products is
destined for direct use by the community itself, and does not take the form of
a commodity. Hence, production here is independent of that division of labour
brought about, in Indian society as a whole, by means of the exchange of
commodities. It is the surplus alone that becomes a commodity, and a portion of
even that, not until it has reached the hands of the State, into whose hands from
time immemorial a certain quantity of these products has found its way in the
shape of rent in kind. The constitution of these communities varies in
different parts of India. In those of the simplest form, the land is tilled in
common, and the produce divided among the members. At the same time, spinning
and weaving are carried on in each family as subsidiary industries. Side by
side with the masses thus occupied with one and the same work, we find the
“chief inhabitant,” who is judge, police, and tax-gatherer in one; the
book-keeper, who keeps the accounts of the tillage and registers everything
relating thereto; another official, who prosecutes criminals, protects
strangers travelling through and escorts them to the next village; the boundary
man, who guards the boundaries against neighbouring communities; the
water-overseer, who distributes the water from the common tanks for irrigation;
the Brahmin, who conducts the religious services; the schoolmaster, who on the
sand teaches the children reading and writing; the calendar-Brahmin, or
astrologer, who makes known the lucky or unlucky days for seed-time and
harvest, and for every other kind of agricultural work; a smith and a
carpenter, who make and repair all the agricultural implements; the potter, who
makes all the pottery of the village; the barber, the washerman, who washes
clothes, the silversmith, here and there the poet, who in some communities
replaces the silversmith, in others the schoolmaster. This dozen of individuals
is maintained at the expense of the whole community. If the population
increases, a new community is founded, on the pattern of the old one, on
unoccupied land. The whole mechanism discloses a systematic division of labour;
but a division like that in manufactures is impossible, since the smith and the
carpenter, &amp;c., find an unchanging market, and at the most there occur,
according to the sizes of the villages, two or three of each, instead of one.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn463" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref463"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">37</span></a> The law that regulates the division of
labour in the community acts with the irresistible authority of a law of
Nature, at the same time that each individual artificer, the smith, the
carpenter, and so on, conducts in his workshop all the operations of his
handicraft in the traditional way, but independently, and without recognising any
authority over him. The simplicity of the organisation for production in these
self-sufficing communities that constantly reproduce themselves in the same
form, and when accidentally destroyed, spring up again on the spot and with the
same name<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn464" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref464"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">38</span></a> - this simplicity
supplies the key to the secret of the unchangeableness of Asiatic societies, an
unchangeableness in such striking contrast with the constant dissolution and
refounding of Asiatic States, and the never-ceasing changes of dynasty. The
structure of the economic elements of society remains untouched by the
storm-clouds of the political sky. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The rules
of the guilds, as I have said before, by limiting most strictly the number of
apprentices and journeymen that a single master could employ, prevented him
from becoming a capitalist. Moreover, he could not employ his journeymen in
many other handicrafts than the one in which he was a master. The guilds
zealously repelled every encroachment by the capital of merchants, the only
form of free capital with which they came in contact. A merchant could buy
every kind of commodity, but labour as a commodity he could not buy. He existed
only on sufferance, as a dealer in the products of the handicrafts. If
circumstances called for a further division of labour, the existing guilds
split themselves up into varieties, or founded new guilds by the side of the
old ones; all this, however, without concentrating various handicrafts in a
single workshop. Hence, the guild organisation, however much it may have
contributed by separating, isolating, and perfecting the handicrafts, to create
the material conditions for the existence of manufacture, excluded division of
labour in the workshop. On the whole, the labourer and his means of production
remained closely united, like the snail with its shell, and thus there was
wanting the principal basis of manufacture, the separation of the labourer from
his means of production, and the conversion of these means into capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">While
division of labour in society at large, whether such division be brought about
or not by exchange of commodities, is common to economic formations of society
the most diverse, division of labour in the workshop, as practised by
manufacture, is a special creation of the capitalist mode of production alone. </span></p>

Capitalistic Character of Manufacture</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An increased number of labourers under the
control of one capitalist is the natural starting-point, as well of
co-operation generally, as of manufacture in particular. But the division of
labour in manufacture makes this increase in the number of workmen a technical
necessity. The minimum number that any given capitalist is bound to employ is
here prescribed by the previously established division of labour. On the other
hand, the advantages of further division are obtainable only by adding to the
number of workmen, and this can be done only by adding multiples of the various
detail groups. But an increase in the variable component of the capital
employed necessitates an increase in its constant component, too, in the
workshops, implements, &amp;c., and, in particular, in the raw material, the
call for which grows quicker than the number of workmen. The quantity of it
consumed in a given time, by a given amount of labour, increases in the same
ratio as does the productive power of that labour in consequence of its
division. Hence, it is a law, based on the very nature of manufacture, that the
minimum amount of capital, which is bound to be in the hands of each
capitalist, must keep increasing; in other words, that the transformation into
capital of the social means of production and subsistence must keep extending.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn465" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref465"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">39</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In manufacture, as well as in simple
co-operation, the collective working organism is a form of existence of
capital. The mechanism that is made up of numerous individual detail labourers
belongs to the capitalist. Hence, the productive power resulting from a
combination of labours appears to be the productive power of capital.
Manufacture proper not only subjects the previously independent workman to the
discipline and command of capital, but, in addition, creates a hierarchic
gradation of the workmen themselves. While simple co-operation leaves the mode
of working by the individual for the most part unchanged, manufacture
thoroughly revolutionises it, and seizes labour-power by its very roots. It
converts the labourer into a crippled monstrosity, by forcing his detail
dexterity at the expense of a world of productive capabilities and instincts;
just as in the States of La Plata they butcher a whole beast for the sake of
his hide or his tallow. Not only is the detail work distributed to the
different individuals, but the individual himself is made the automatic motor
of a fractional operation,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn466" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref466"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">40</span></a> and the
absurd fable of Menenius Agrippa, which makes man a mere fragment of his own
body, becomes realised.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn467" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref467"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">41</span></a> If, at
first, the workman sells his labour-power to capital, because the material
means of producing a commodity fail him, now his very labour-power refuses its
services unless it has been sold to capital. Its functions can be exercised
only in an environment that exists in the workshop of the capitalist after the
sale. By nature unfitted to make anything independently, the manufacturing
labourer develops productive activity as a mere appendage of the capitalist’s
workshop.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn468" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref468"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">42</span></a> As the chosen people bore
in their features the sign manual of Jehovah, so division of labour brands the
manufacturing workman as the property of capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The knowledge, the judgement, and the will,
which, though in ever so small a degree, are practised by the independent
peasant or handicraftsman, in the same way as the savage makes the whole art of
war consist in the exercise of his personal cunning these faculties are now
required only for the workshop as a whole. Intelligence in production expands
in one direction, because it vanishes in many others. What is lost by the
detail labourers, is concentrated in the capital that employs them.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn469" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref469"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">43</span></a> It is a result of the division of labour
in manufactures, that the labourer is brought face to face with the
intellectual potencies of the material process of production, as the property
of another, and as a ruling power. This separation begins in simple
co-operation, where the capitalist represents to the single workman, the
oneness and the will of the associated labour. It is developed in manufacture
which cuts down the labourer into a detail labourer. It is completed in modern
industry, which makes science a productive force distinct from labour and
presses it into the service of capital.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn470" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref470"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">44</span></a>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Ignorance is
the mother of industry as well as of superstition. Reflection and fancy are
subject to err; but a habit of moving the hand or the foot is independent of

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The
uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind...
It corrupts even the activity of his body and renders him incapable of exerting
his strength with vigour and perseverance in any other employments than that to
which he has been bred. His dexterity at his own particular trade seems in this
manner to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social, and martial
virtues. But in every improved and civilised society, this is the state into
which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must
necessarily fall.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn473" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref473"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">47</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For preventing the complete deterioration of the
great mass of the people by division of labour, A. Smith recommends education
of the people by the State, but prudently, and in homeopathic doses. G.
Garnier, his French translator and commentator, who, under the first French
Empire, quite naturally developed into a senator, quite as naturally opposes
him on this point. Education of the masses, he urges, violates the first law of
the division of labour, and with it</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“our whole
social system would be proscribed.” "Like all other divisions of labour,”
he says, “that between hand labour and head labour <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn474" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref474"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">48</span></a> is more pronounced and decided in
proportion as society (he rightly uses this word, for capital, landed property
and their State) becomes richer. This division of labour, like every other, is
an effect of past, and a cause of future progress... ought the government then
to work in opposition to this division of labour, and to hinder its natural
course? Ought it to expend a part of the public money in the attempt to
confound and blend together two classes of labour, which are striving after
division and separation?”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn475" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref475"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">49</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some crippling of body and mind is inseparable
even from division of labour in society as a whole. Since, however, manufacture
carries this social separation of branches of labour much further, and also, by
its peculiar division, attacks the individual at the very roots of his life<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn476" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref476"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">50</span></a>, it is the first to afford the materials

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Co-operation based on division of labour, in
other words, manufacture, commences as a spontaneous formation. So soon as it
attains some consistence and extension, it becomes the recognised methodical
and systematic form of capitalist production. History shows how the division of
labour peculiar to manufacture, strictly so called, acquires the best adapted
form at first by experience, as it were behind the backs of the actors, and
then, like the guild handicrafts, strives to hold fast that form when once
found, and here and there succeeds in keeping it for centuries. Any alteration
in this form, except in trivial matters, is solely owing to a revolution in the
instruments of labour. Modern manufacture wherever it arises - I do not
here allude to modern industry based on machinery - either finds the
disjecta membra poetae ready to hand, and only waiting to be collected
together, as is the case in the manufacture of clothes in large towns, or it
can easily apply the principle of division, simply by exclusively assigning the
various operations of a handicraft (such as book-binding) to particular men. In
such cases, a week’s experience is enough to determine the proportion between
the numbers of the hands necessary for the various functions.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn478" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref478"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">52</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By decomposition of handicrafts, by
specialisation of the instruments of labour, by the formation of detail
labourers, and by grouping and combining the latter into a single mechanism,
division of labour in manufacture creates a qualitative gradation, and a quantitative
proportion in the social process of production; it consequently creates a
definite organisation of the labour of society, and thereby develops at the
same time new productive forces in the society. In its specific capitalist form
- and under the given conditions, it could take no other form than a
capitalistic one - manufacture is but a particular method of begetting
relative surplus-value, or of augmenting at the expense of the labourer the
self-expansion of capital - usually called social wealth, “Wealth of
Nations,” &amp;c. It increases the social productive power of labour, not only
for the benefit of the capitalist instead of for that of the labourer, but it
does this by crippling the individual labourers. It creates new conditions for
the lordship of capital over labour. If, therefore, on the one hand, it
presents itself historically as a progress and as a necessary phase in the
economic development of society, on the other hand, it is a refined and
civilised method of exploitation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Political Economy, which as an independent
science, first sprang into being during the period of manufacture, views the
social division of labour only from the standpoint of manufacture,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn479" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref479"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">53</span></a> and sees in it only the means of
producing more commodities with a given quantity of labour, and, consequently,
of cheapening commodities and hurrying on the accumulation of capital. In most
striking contrast with this accentuation of quantity and exchange-value, is the
attitude of the writers of classical antiquity, who hold exclusively by quality
and use-value.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn480" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref480"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">54</span></a> In consequence of the
separation of the social branches of production, commodities are better made,
the various bents and talents of men select a suitable field,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn481" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref481"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">55</span></a> and without some restraint no important
results can be obtained anywhere.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn482" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref482"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">56</span></a>
Hence both product and producer are improved by division of labour. If the
growth of the quantity produced is occasionally mentioned, this is only done
with reference to the greater abundance of use-values. There is not a word
alluding to exchange-value or to the cheapening of commodities. This aspect,
from the standpoint of use-value alone, is taken as well by Plato,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn483" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref483"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">57</span></a><span> 
</span>who treats division of labour as the foundation on which the division of
society into classes is based, as by Xenophon<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn484" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref484"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">58</span></a>,
who with characteristic bourgeois instinct, approaches more nearly to division
of labour within the workshop. Plato’s Republic, in so far as division of
labour is treated in it, as the formative principle of the State, is merely the
Athenian idealisation of the Egyptian system of castes, Egypt having served as
the model of an industrial country to many of his contemporaries also, amongst
others to Isocrates,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn485" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref485"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">59</span></a> and it
continued to have this importance to the Greeks of the Roman Empire.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn486" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref486"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">60</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">During the manufacturing period proper, i.e.,
the period during which manufacture is the predominant form taken by capitalist
production, many obstacles are opposed to the full development of the peculiar
tendencies of manufacture. Although manufacture creates, as we have already
seen, a simple separation of the labourers into skilled and unskilled,
simultaneously with their hierarchic arrangement in classes, yet the number of
the unskilled labourers, owing to the preponderating influence of the skilled,
remains very limited. Although it adapts the detail operations to the various
degrees of maturity, strength, and development of the living instruments of
labour, thus conducing to exploitation of women and children, yet this tendency
as a whole is wrecked on the habits and the resistance of the male labourers.
Although the splitting up of handicrafts lowers the cost of forming the
workman, and thereby lowers his value, yet for the more difficult detail work,
a longer apprenticeship is necessary, and, even where it would be superfluous,
is jealously insisted upon by the workmen. In England, for instance, we find
the laws of apprenticeship, with their seven years’ probation, in full force
down to the end of the manufacturing period; and they are not thrown on one
side till the advent of Modern Industry. Since handicraft skill is the
foundation of manufacture, and since the mechanism of manufacture as a whole
possesses no framework, apart from the labourers themselves, capital is
constantly compelled to wrestle with the insubordination of the workmen. </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“By the
infirmity of human nature,” says friend Ure, “it happens that the more skilful
the workman, the more self-willed and intractable he is apt to become, and of
course the less fit a component of a mechanical system in which ... he may do
great damage to the whole”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn487" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref487"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">61</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hence throughout the whole manufacturing period
there runs the complaint of want of discipline among the workmen<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn488" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref488"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">62</span></a>. And had we not the testimony of
contemporary writers, the simple facts, that during the period between the 16th
century and the epoch of Modern Industry, capital failed to become the master
of the whole disposable working-time of the manufacturing labourers, that
manufactures are short-lived, and change their locality from one country to
another with the emigrating or immigrating workmen, these facts would speak
volumes. “Order must in one way or another be established,” exclaims in 1770
the oft-cited author of the “Essay on Trade and Commerce.” “Order,” re-echoes
Dr. Andrew Ure 66 years later, “Order” was wanting in manufacture based on “the
scholastic dogma of division of labour,” and “Arkwright created order.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At the same time manufacture was unable, either
to seize upon the production of society to its full extent, or to revolutionise
that production to its very core. It towered up as an economic work of art, on
the broad foundation of the town handicrafts, and of the rural domestic
industries. At a given stage in its development, the narrow technical basis on
which manufacture rested, came into conflict with requirements of production
that were created by manufacture itself. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One of its most finished creations was the
workshop for the production of the instruments of labour themselves, including
especially the complicated mechanical apparatus then already employed.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">A
machine-factory, says Ure, “displayed the division of labour in manifold
gradations - the file, the drill, the lathe, having each its different
workman in the order of skill.” (P. 21.)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This workshop, the product of the division of
labour in manufacture, produced in its turn - machines. It is they that
sweep away the handicraftsman’s work as the regulating principle of social
production. Thus, on the one hand, the technical reason for the life-long
annexation of the workman to a detail function is removed. On the other hand,
the fetters that this same principle laid on the dominion of capital, fall
away. </span></p>
