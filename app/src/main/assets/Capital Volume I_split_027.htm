Development of Machinery</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">John Stuart Mill says in his “Principles of
Political Economy":</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“It is
questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day’s
toil of any human being.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn489" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref489"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">That is, however, by no means the aim of the
capitalistic application of machinery. Like every other increase in the
productiveness of labour, machinery is intended to cheapen commodities, and, by
shortening that portion of the working day, in which the labourer works for
himself, to lengthen the other portion that he gives, without an equivalent, to
the capitalist. In short, it is a means for producing surplus-value.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In manufacture, the revolution in the mode of
production begins with the labour-power, in modern industry it begins with the
instruments of labour. Our first inquiry then is, how the instruments of labour
are converted from tools into machines, or what is the difference between a
machine and the implements of a handicraft? We are only concerned here with
striking and general characteristics; for epochs in the history of society are
no more separated from each other by hard and fast lines of demarcation, than
are geological epochs. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mathematicians and mechanicians, and in this
they are followed by a few English economists, call a tool a simple machine,
and a machine a complex tool. They see no essential difference between them,
and even give the name of machine to the simple mechanical powers, the lever,
the inclined plane, the screw, the wedge, &amp;c.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn490" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref490"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a>
As a matter of fact, every machine is a combination of those simple powers, no
matter how they may be disguised. From the economic standpoint this explanation
is worth nothing, because the historical element is wanting. Another
explanation of the difference between tool and machine is that in the case of a
tool, man is the motive power, while the motive power of a machine is something
different from man, as, for instance, an animal, water, wind, and so on.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn491" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref491"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a> According to this, a plough drawn by oxen,
which is a contrivance common to the most different epochs, would be a machine,
while Claussen’s circular loom, which, worked by a single labourer, weaves
96,000 picks per minute, would be a mere tool. Nay, this very loom, though a
tool when worked by hand, would, if worked by steam, be a machine. And since
the application of animal power is one of man’s earliest inventions, production
by machinery would have preceded production by handicrafts. When in 1735, John
Wyatt brought out his spinning machine, and began the industrial revolution of
the 18th century, not a word did he say about an ass driving it instead of a
man, and yet this part fell to the ass. He described it as a machine “to spin
without fingers.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn492" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref492"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">All fully developed machinery consists of three
essentially different parts, the motor mechanism, the transmitting mechanism,
and finally the tool or working machine. The motor mechanism is that which puts
the whole in motion. It either generates its own motive power, like the
steam-engine, the caloric engine, the electromagnetic machine, &amp;c., or it
receives its impulse from some already existing natural force, like the
water-wheel from a head of water, the wind-mill from wind, &amp;c. The
transmitting mechanism, composed of fly-wheels, shafting, toothed wheels,
pullies, straps, ropes, bands, pinions, and gearing of the most varied kinds,
regulates the motion, changes its form where necessary, as for instance, from
linear to circular, and divides and distributes it among the working machines.
These two first parts of the whole mechanism are there, solely for putting the
working machines in motion, by means of which motion the subject of labour is
seized upon and modified as desired. The tool or working machine is that part
of the machinery with which the industrial revolution of the 18th century
started. And to this day it constantly serves as such a starting-point,
whenever a handicraft, or a manufacture, is turned into an industry carried on
by machinery. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On a closer examination of the working machine
proper, we find in it, as a general rule, though often, no doubt, under very
altered forms, the apparatus and tools used by the handicraftsman or
manufacturing workman; with this difference, that instead of being human
implements, they are the implements of a mechanism, or mechanical implements.
Either the entire machine is only a more or less altered mechanical edition of
the old handicraft tool, as, for instance, the power-loom,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn493" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref493"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> or the working parts fitted in the frame
of the machine are old acquaintances, as spindles are in a mule, needles in a
stocking-loom, saws in a sawing-machine, and knives in a chopping machine. The
distinction between these tools and the body proper of the machine, exists from
their very birth; for they continue for the most part to be produced by
handicraft, or by manufacture, and are afterwards fitted into the body of the
machine, which is the product of machinery.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn494" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref494"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a>
The machine proper is therefore a mechanism that, after being set in motion,
performs with its tools the same operations that were formerly done by the
workman with similar tools. Whether the motive power is derived from man, or
from some other machine, makes no difference in this respect. From the moment
that the tool proper is taken from man, and fitted into a mechanism, a machine
takes the place of a mere implement. The difference strikes one at once, even
in those cases where man himself continues to be the prime mover. The number of
implements that he himself can use simultaneously, is limited by the number of
his own natural instruments of production, by the number of his bodily organs.
In Germany, they tried at first to make one spinner work two spinning-wheels,
that is, to work simultaneously with both hands and both feet. This was too
difficult. Later, a treddle spinning-wheel with two spindles was invented, but
adepts in spinning, who could spin two threads at once, were almost as scarce
as two-headed men. The Jenny, on the other hand, even at its very birth, spun
with 12-18 spindles, and the stocking-loom knits with many thousand needles at
once. The number of tools that a machine can bring into play simultaneously, is
from the very first emancipated from the organic limits that hedge in the tools
of a handicraftsman. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In many manual implements the distinction
between man as mere motive power, and man as the workman or operator properly
so called, is brought into striking contrast. For instance, the foot is merely
the prime mover of the spinning-wheel, while the hand, working with the
spindle, and drawing and twisting, performs the real operation of spinning. It
is this last part of the handicraftsman’s implement that is first seized upon
by the industrial revolution, leaving to the workman, in addition to his new
labour of watching the machine with his eyes and correcting its mistakes with
his hands, the merely mechanical part of being the moving power. On the other
hand, implements, in regard to which man has always acted as a simple motive
power, as, for instance, by turning the crank of a mill,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn495" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref495"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a> by pumping, by moving up and down the arm
of a bellows, by pounding with a mortar, &amp;c., such implements soon call for
the application of animals, water<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn496" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref496"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a>
and wind as motive powers. Here and there, long before the period of
manufacture, and also, to some extent, during that period, these implements
pass over into machines, but without creating any revolution in the mode of
production. It becomes evident, in the period of modern industry, that these
implements, even under their form of manual tools, are already machines. For
instance, the pumps with which the Dutch, in 1836-7, emptied the Lake of
Harlem, were constructed on the principle of ordinary pumps; the only
difference being, that their pistons were driven by cyclopean steam-engines,
instead of by men. The common and very imperfect bellows of the blacksmith is,
in England, occasionally converted into a blowing-engine, by connecting its arm
with a steam-engine. The steam-engine itself, such as it was at its invention,
during the manufacturing period at the close of the 17th century, and such as
it continued to be down to 1780,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn497" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref497"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a> did not
give rise to any industrial revolution. It was, on the contrary, the invention
of machines that made a revolution in the form of steam-engines necessary. As
soon as man, instead of working with an implement on the subject of his labour,
becomes merely the motive power of an implement-machine, it is a mere accident
that motive power takes the disguise of human muscle; and it may equally well
take the form of wind, water or steam. Of course, this does not prevent such a
change of form from producing great technical alterations in the mechanism that
was originally constructed to be driven by man alone. Now-a-days, all machines
that have their way to make, such as sewing-machines, bread-making machines,
&amp;c., are, unless from their very nature their use on a small scale is
excluded, constructed to be driven both by human and by purely mechanical
motive power. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The machine, which is the starting-point of the
industrial revolution, supersedes the workman, who handles a single tool, by a
mechanism operating with a number of similar tools, and set in motion by a
single motive power, whatever the form of that power may be.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn498" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref498"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a> Here we have the machine, but only as an
elementary factor of production by machinery. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Increase in the size of the machine, and in the
number of its working tools, calls for a more massive mechanism to drive it;
and this mechanism requires, in order to overcome its resistance, a mightier
moving power than that of man, apart from the fact that man is a very imperfect
instrument for producing uniform continued motion. But assuming that he is
acting simply as a motor, that a machine has taken the place of his tool, it is
evident that he can be replaced by natural forces. Of all the great motors
handed down from the manufacturing period, horse-power is the worst, partly
because a horse has a head of his own, partly because he is costly, and the
extent to which he is applicable in factories is very restricted.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn499" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref499"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a> Nevertheless the horse was extensively
used during the infancy of modern industry. This is proved, as well by the
complaints of contemporary agriculturists, as by the term “horse-power,” which
has survived to this day as an expression for mechanical force. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Wind was too inconstant and uncontrollable, and
besides, in England, the birthplace of modern industry, the use of water power
preponderated even during the manufacturing period. In the 17th century
attempts had already been made to turn two pairs of millstones with a single
water-wheel. But the increased size of the gearing was too much for the water
power, which had now become insufficient, and this was one of the circumstances
that led to a more accurate investigation of the laws of friction. In the same
way the irregularity caused by the motive power in mills that were put in
motion by pushing and pulling a lever, led to the theory, and the application,
of the fly-wheel, which afterwards plays so important a part in modern
industry.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn500" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref500"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a> In this way, during the
manufacturing period, were developed the first scientific and technical
elements of Modern Mechanical Industry. Arkwright’s throstle spinning mill was
from the very first turned by water. But for all that, the use of water, as the
predominant motive power, was beset with difficulties. It could not be
increased at will, it failed at certain seasons of the year, and, above all, it
was essentially local.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn501" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref501"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">13</span></a> Not till
the invention of Watt’s second and so-called double-acting steam-engine, was a
prime mover found, that begot its own force by the consumption of coal and
water, whose power was entirely under man’s control, that was mobile and a
means of locomotion, that was urban and not, like the waterwheel, rural, that
permitted production to be concentrated in towns instead of, like the
water-wheels, being scattered up and down the country,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn502" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref502"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">14</span></a> that was of universal technical
application, and, relatively speaking, little affected in its choice of
residence by local circumstances. The greatness of Watt’s genius showed itself
in the specification of the patent that he took out in April, 1784. In that
specification his steam-engine is described, not as an invention for a specific
purpose, but as an agent universally applicable in Mechanical Industry. In it
he points out applications, many of which, as for instance, the steam-hammer,
were not introduced till half a century later. Nevertheless he doubted the use
of steam-engines in navigation. His successors, Boulton and Watt, sent to the
exhibition of 1851 steam-engines of colossal size for ocean steamers. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As soon as tools had been converted from being
manual implements of man into implements of a mechanical apparatus, of a machine,
the motive mechanism also acquired an independent form, entirely emancipated
from the restraints of human strength. Thereupon the individual machine, that
we have hitherto been considering, sinks into a mere factor in production by
machinery. One motive mechanism was now able to drive many machines at once.
The motive mechanism grows with the number of the machines that are turned
simultaneously, and the transmitting mechanism becomes a wide-spreading
apparatus. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We now proceed to distinguish the co-operation
of a number of machines of one kind from a complex system of machinery. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the one case, the product is entirely made by
a single machine, which performs all the various operations previously done by
one handicraftsman with his tool; as, for instance, by a weaver with his loom;
or by several handicraftsman successively, either separately or as members of a
system of Manufacture.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn503" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref503"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">15</span></a> For
example, in the manufacture of envelopes, one man folded the paper with the
folder, another laid on the gum, a third turned the flap over, on which the
device is impressed, a fourth embossed the device, and so on; and for each of
these operations the envelope had to change hands. One single envelope machine
now performs all these operations at once, and makes more than 3,000 envelopes
in an hour. In the London exhibition of 1862, there was an American machine for
making paper cornets. It cut the paper, pasted, folded, and finished 300 in a
minute. Here, the whole process, which, when carried on as Manufacture, was
split up into, and carried out by, a series of operations, is completed by a
single machine, working a combination of various tools. Now, whether such a
machine be merely a reproduction of a complicated manual implement, or a
combination of various simple implements specialised by Manufacture, in either
case, in the factory, <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>., in the workshop in which machinery alone is
used, we meet again with simple co-operation; and, leaving the workman out of
consideration for the moment, this co-operation presents itself to us, in the
first instance, as the conglomeration in one place of similar and
simultaneously acting machines. Thus, a weaving factory is constituted of a
number of power-looms, working side by side, and a sewing factory of a number
of sewing-machines all in the same building. But there is here a technical
oneness in the whole system, owing to all the machines receiving their impulse
simultaneously, and in an equal degree, from the pulsations of the common prime
mover, by the intermediary of the transmitting mechanism; and this mechanism,
to a certain extent, is also common to them all, since only particular
ramifications of it branch off to each machine. Just as a number of tools,
then, form the organs of a machine, so a number of machines of one kind constitute
the organs of the motive mechanism. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A real machinery system, however, does not take
the place of these independent machines, until the subject of labour goes
through a connected series of detail processes, that are carried out by a chain
of machines of various kinds, the one supplementing the other. Here we have
again the co-operation by division of labour that characterises Manufacture;
only now, it is a combination of detail machines. The special tools of the
various detail workmen, such as those of the beaters, cambers, spinners,
&amp;c., in the woollen manufacture, are now transformed into the tools of
specialised machines, each machine constituting a special organ, with a special
function, in the system. In those branches of industry in which the machinery
system is first introduced, Manufacture itself furnishes, in a general way, the
natural basis for the division, and consequent organisation, of the process of
production.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn504" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref504"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">16</span></a> Nevertheless an essential
difference at once manifests itself. In Manufacture it is the workmen who, with
their manual implements, must, either singly or in groups, carry on each
particular detail process. If, on the one hand, the workman becomes adapted to
the process, on the other, the process was previously made suitable to the
workman. This subjective principle of the division of labour no longer exists
in production by machinery. Here, the process as a whole is examined
objectively, in itself, that is to say, without regard to the question of its
execution by human hands, it is analysed into its constituent phases; and the
problem, how to execute each detail process, and bind them all into a whole, is
solved by the aid of machines, chemistry, &amp;c.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn505" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref505"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">17</span></a>
But, of course, in this case also, theory must be perfected by accumulated experience
on a large scale. Each detail machine supplies raw material to the machine next
in order; and since they are all working at the same time, the product is
always going through the various stages of its fabrication, and is also
constantly in a state of transition, from one phase to another. Just as in
Manufacture, the direct co-operation of the detail labourers establishes a
numerical proportion between the special groups, so in an organised system of
machinery, where one detail machine is constantly kept employed by another, a
fixed relation is established between their numbers, their size, and their
speed. The collective machine, now an organised system of various kinds of
single machines, and of groups of single machines, becomes more and more perfect,
the more the process as a whole becomes a continuous one, i.e., the less the
raw material is interrupted in its passage from its first phase to its last; in
other words, the more its passage from one phase to another is effected, not by
the hand of man, but by the machinery itself. In Manufacture the isolation of
each detail process is a condition imposed by the nature of division of labour,
but in the fully developed factory the continuity of those processes is, on the
contrary, imperative. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A system of machinery, whether it reposes on the
mere co-operation of similar machines, as in weaving, or on a combination of
different machines, as in spinning, constitutes in itself a huge automaton,
whenever it is driven by a self-acting prime mover. But although the factory as
a whole be driven by its steam-engine, yet either some of the individual
machines may require the aid of the workman for some of their movements (such
aid was necessary for the running in of the mule carriage, before the invention
of the self-acting mule, and is still necessary in fine-spinning mills); or, to
enable a machine to do its work, certain parts of it may require to be handled
by the workman like a manual tool; this was the case in machine-makers’
workshops, before the conversion of the slide rest into a self-actor. As soon
as a machine executes, without man’s help, all the movements requisite to
elaborate the raw material, needing only attendance from him, we have an
automatic system of machinery, and one that is susceptible of constant
improvement in its details. Such improvements as the apparatus that stops a
drawing frame, whenever a sliver breaks, and the self-acting stop, that stops
the power-loom so soon as the shuttle bobbin is emptied of weft, are quite
modern inventions. As an example, both of continuity of production, and of the
carrying out of the automatic principle, we may take a modern paper mill. In
the paper industry generally, we may advantageously study in detail not only
the distinctions between modes of production based on different means of
production, but also the connexion of the social conditions of production with
those modes: for the old German paper-making furnishes us with a sample of
handicraft production; that of Holland in the 17th and of France in the 18th
century with a sample of manufacturing in the strict sense; and that of modern
England with a sample of automatic fabrication of this article. Besides these,
there still exist, in India and China, two distinct antique Asiatic forms of
the same industry. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An organised system of machines, to which motion
is communicated by the transmitting mechanism from a central automaton, is the
most developed form of production by machinery. Here we have, in the place of
the isolated machine, a mechanical monster whose body fills whole factories,
and whose demon power, at first veiled under the slow and measured motions of
his giant limbs, at length breaks out into the fast and furious whirl of his
countless working organs. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There were mules and steam-engines before there
were any labourers, whose exclusive occupation it was to make mules and
steam-engines; just as men wore clothes before there were such people as
tailors. The inventions of Vaucanson, Arkwright, Watt, and others, were,
however, practicable, only because those inventors found, ready to hand, a
considerable number of skilled mechanical workmen, placed at their disposal by
the manufacturing period. Some of these workmen were independent handicraftsman
of various trades, others were grouped together in manufactures, in which, as
before-mentioned, division of labour was strictly carried out. As inventions
increased in number, and the demand for the newly discovered machines grew
larger, the machine-making industry split up, more and more, into numerous
independent branches, and division of labour in these manufactures was more and
more developed. Here, then, we see in Manufacture the immediate technical
foundation of modern industry. Manufacture produced the machinery, by means of
which modern industry abolished the handicraft and manufacturing systems in
those spheres of production that it first seized upon. The factory system was
therefore raised, in the natural course of things, on an inadequate foundation.
When the system attained to a certain degree of development, it had to root up
this ready-made foundation, which in the meantime had been elaborated on the
old lines, and to build up for itself a basis that should correspond to its
methods of production. Just as the individual machine retains a dwarfish character,
so long as it is worked by the power of man alone, and just as no system of
machinery could be properly developed before the steam-engine took the place of
the earlier motive powers, animals, wind, and even water; so, too, modern
industry was crippled in its complete development, so long as its
characteristic instrument of production, the machine, owed its existence to
personal strength and personal skill, and depended on the muscular development,
the keenness of sight, and the cunning of hand, with which the detail workmen
in manufactures, and the manual labourers in handicrafts, wielded their
dwarfish implements. Thus, apart from the dearness of the machines made in this
way, a circumstance that is ever present to the mind of the capitalist, the expansion
of industries carried on by means of machinery, and the invasion by machinery
of fresh branches of production, were dependent on the growth of a class of
workmen, who, owing to the almost artistic nature of their employment, could
increase their numbers only gradually, and not by leaps and bounds. But besides
this, at a certain stage of its development, modern industry became
technologically incompatible with the basis furnished for it by handicraft and
Manufacture. The increasing size of the prime movers, of the transmitting
mechanism, and of the machines proper, the greater complication, multiformity
and regularity of the details of these machines, as they more and more departed
from the model of those originally made by manual labour, and acquired a form,
untrammelled except by the conditions under which they worked,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn506" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref506"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">18</span></a> the perfecting of the automatic system,
and the use, every day more unavoidable, of a more refractory material, such as
iron instead of wood - the solution of all these problems, which sprang
up by the force of circumstances, everywhere met with a stumbling-block in the
personal restrictions, which even the collective labourer of Manufacture could
not break through, except to a limited extent. Such machines as the modern
hydraulic press, the modern power-loom, and the modern carding engine, could
never have been furnished by Manufacture. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A radical change in the mode of production in
one sphere of industry involves a similar change in other spheres. This happens
at first in such branches of industry as are connected together by being
separate phases of a process, and yet are isolated by the social division of
labour, in such a way, that each of them produces an independent commodity.
Thus spinning by machinery made weaving by machinery a necessity, and both
together made the mechanical and chemical revolution that took place in
bleaching, printing, and dyeing, imperative. So too, on the other hand, the
revolution in cotton-spinning called forth the invention of the gin, for
separating the seeds from the cotton fibre; it was only by means of this
invention, that the production of cotton became possible on the enormous scale
at present required.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn507" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref507"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">19</span></a> But more
especially, the revolution in the modes of production of industry and
agriculture made necessary a revolution in the general conditions of the social
process of production, i.e., in the means of communication and of transport. In
a society whose pivot, to use an expression of Fourier, was agriculture on a
small scale, with its subsidiary domestic industries, and the urban
handicrafts, the means of communication and transport were so utterly
inadequate to the productive requirements of the manufacturing period, with its
extended division of social labour, its concentration of the instruments of
labour, and of the workmen, and its colonial markets, that they became in fact
revolutionised. In the same way the means of communication and transport handed
down from the manufacturing period soon became unbearable trammels on modern
industry, with its feverish haste of production, its enormous extent, its
constant flinging of capital and labour from one sphere of production into
another, and its newly-created connexions with the markets of the whole world.
Hence, apart from the radical changes introduced in the construction of sailing
vessels, the means of communication and transport became gradually adapted to
the modes of production of mechanical industry, by the creation of a system of
river steamers, railways, ocean steamers, and telegraphs. But the huge masses
of iron that had now to be forged, to be welded, to be cut, to be bored, and to
be shaped, demanded, on their part, cyclopean machines, for the construction of
which the methods of the manufacturing period were utterly inadequate. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Modern Industry had therefore itself to take in
hand the machine, its characteristic instrument of production, and to construct
machines by machines. It was not till it did this, that it built up for itself
a fitting technical foundation, and stood on its own feet. Machinery,
simultaneously with the increasing use of it, in the first decades of this
century, appropriated, by degrees, the fabrication of machines proper. But it
was only during the decade preceding 1866, that the construction of railways
and ocean steamers on a stupendous scale called into existence the cyclopean
machines now employed in the construction of prime movers. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The most essential condition to the production
of machines by machines was a prime mover capable of exerting any amount of
force, and yet under perfect control. Such a condition was already supplied by
the steam-engine. But at the same time it was necessary to produce the
geometrically accurate straight lines, planes, circles, cylinders, cones, and
spheres, required in the detail parts of the machines. This problem Henry
Maudsley solved in the first decade of this century by the invention of the
slide rest, a tool that was soon made automatic, and in a modified form was
applied to other constructive machines besides the lathe, for which it was
originally intended. This mechanical appliance replaces, not some particular
tool, but the hand itself, which produces a given form by holding and guiding
the cutting tool along the iron or other material operated upon. Thus it became
possible to produce the forms of the individual parts of machinery</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“with a
degree of ease, accuracy, and speed, that no accumulated experience of the hand
of the most skilled workman could give.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn508" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref508"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">20</span></a>
<a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a22"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If we now fix our attention on that portion of
the machinery employed in the construction of machines, which constitutes the
operating tool, we find the manual implements re-appearing, but on a cyclopean
scale. The operating part of the boring machine is an immense drill driven by a
steam-engine; without this machine, on the other hand, the cylinders of large
steam-engines and of hydraulic presses could not be made. The mechanical lathe
is only a cyclopean reproduction of the ordinary foot-lathe; the planing
machine, an iron carpenter, that works on iron with the same tools that the
human carpenter employs on wood; the instrument that, on the London wharves,
cuts the veneers, is a gigantic razor; the tool of the shearing machine, which
shears iron as easily as a tailor’s scissors cut cloth, is a monster pair of
scissors; and the steam-hammer works with an ordinary hammer head, but of such
a weight that not Thor himself could wield it.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn509" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref509"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">21</span></a>
These steam-hammers are an invention of Nasmyth, and there is one that weighs
over 6 tons and strikes with a vertical fall of 7 feet, on an anvil weighing 36
tons. It is mere child’s-play for it to crush a block of granite into powder,
yet it is no less capable of driving, with a succession of light taps, a nail
into a piece of soft wood.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn510" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref510"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">22</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The implements of labour, in the form of
machinery, necessitate the substitution of natural forces for human force, and
the conscious application of science, instead of rule of thumb. In Manufacture,
the organisation of the social labour-process is purely subjective; it is a
combination of detail labourers; in its machinery system, modern industry has a
productive organism that is purely objective, in which the labourer becomes a
mere appendage to an already existing material condition of production. In
simple co-operation, and even in that founded on division of labour, the
suppression of the isolated, by the collective, workman still appears to be
more or less accidental. Machinery, with a few exceptions to be mentioned
later, operates only by means of associated labour, or labour in common. Hence
the co-operative character of the labour-process is, in the latter case, a
technical necessity dictated by the instrument of labour itself. </span></p>

<h3 class="calibre23"><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="_Toc273516439"></a><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="__RefHeading__754_1418669237"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre20"></span><span class="calibre20"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">Section 2:<span class="calibre20">  </span>The Value Transferred by Machinery to the
Product</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We saw that
the productive forces resulting from co-operation and division of labour cost
capital nothing. They are natural forces of social labour. So also physical
forces, like steam, water, &amp;c., when appropriated to productive processes,
cost nothing. But just as a man requires lungs to breathe with, so he requires
something that is work of man’s hand, in order to consume physical forces
productively. A water-wheel is necessary to exploit the force of water, and a
steam-engine to exploit the elasticity of steam. Once discovered, the law of
the deviation of the magnetic needle in the field of an electric current, or
the law of the magnetisation of iron, around which an electric current
circulates, cost never a penny.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn511" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref511"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">23</span></a> But the
exploitation of these laws for the purposes of telegraphy, &amp;c.,
necessitates a costly and extensive apparatus. The tool, as we have seen, is
not exterminated by the machine. From being a dwarf implement of the human
organism, it expands and multiplies into the implement of a mechanism created
by man. Capital now sets the labourer to work, not with a manual tool, but with
a machine which itself handles the tools. Although, therefore, it is clear at
the first glance that, by incorporating both stupendous physical forces, and
the natural sciences, with the process of production, modern industry raises the
productiveness of labour to an extraordinary degree, it is by no means equally
clear, that this increased productive force is not, on the other hand,
purchased by an increased expenditure of labour. Machinery, like every other
component of constant capital, creates no new value, but yields up its own
value to the product that it serves to beget. In so far as the machine has
value, and, in consequence, parts with value to the product, it forms an
element in the value of that product. Instead of being cheapened, the product
is made dearer in proportion to the value of the machine. And it is clear as
noon-day, that machines and systems of machinery, the characteristic
instruments of labour of Modern Industry, are incomparably more loaded with
value than the implements used in handicrafts and manufactures. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
first place, it must be observed that the machinery, while always entering as a
whole into the labour-process, enters into the value-begetting process only by
bits. It never adds more value than it loses, on an average, by wear and tear.
Hence there is a great difference between the value of a machine, and the value
transferred in a given time by that machine to the product. The longer the life
of the machine in the labour-process, the greater is that difference. It is
true, no doubt, as we have already seen, that every instrument of labour enters
as a whole into the labour-process, and only piece-meal, proportionally to its
average daily loss by wear and tear, into the value-begetting process. But this
difference between the instrument as a whole and its daily wear and tear, is
much greater in a machine than in a tool, because the machine, being made from
more durable material, has a longer life; because its employment, being
regulated by strictly scientific laws, allows of greater economy in the wear
and tear of its parts, and in the materials it consumes; and lastly, because
its field of production is incomparably larger than that of a tool. After
making allowance, both in the case of the machine and of the tool, for their
average daily cost, that is for the value they transmit to the product by their
average daily wear and tear, and for their consumption of auxiliary substance,
such as oil, coal, and so on, they each do their work gratuitously, just like
the forces furnished by Nature without the help of man. The greater the
productive power of the machinery compared with that of the tool, the greater
is the extent of its gratuitous service compared with that of the tool. In
modern industry man succeeded for the first time in making the product of his
past labour work on a large scale gratuitously, like the forces of Nature.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn512" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref512"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">24</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In treating
of Co-operation and Manufacture, it was shown that certain general factors of
production, such as buildings, are, in comparison with the scattered means of
production of the isolated workman, economised by being consumed in common, and
that they therefore make the product cheaper. In a system of machinery, not
only is the framework of the machine consumed in common by its numerous
operating implements, but the prime mover, together with a part of the
transmitting mechanism, is consumed in common by the numerous operative
machines. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Given the
difference between the value of the machinery, and the value transferred by it
in a day to the product, the extent to which this latter value makes the
product dearer, depends in the first instance, upon the size of the product; so
to say, upon its area. Mr. Baynes, of Blackburn, in a lecture published in
1858, estimates that</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“each real
mechanical horse-power<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn513" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref513"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">25</span></a><span>  </span>will drive 450 self-acting mule spindles,
with preparation, or 200 throstle spindles, or 15 looms for 40 inch cloth with
the appliances for warping, sizing, &amp;c.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
first case, it is the day’s produce of 450 mule spindles, in the second, of 200
throstle spindles, in the third, of 15 power-looms, over which the daily cost
of one horse-power, and the wear and tear of the machinery set in motion by
that power, are spread; so that only a very minute value is transferred by such
wear and tear to a pound of yarn or a yard of cloth. The same is the case with
the steam-hammer mentioned above. Since its daily wear and tear, its
coal-consumption, &amp;c., are spread over the stupendous masses of iron
hammered by it in a day, only a small value is added to a hundred weight of
iron; but that value would be very great, if the cyclopean instrument were
employed in driving in nails. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Given a
machine’s capacity for work, that is, the number of its operating tools, or,
where it is a question of force, their mass, the amount of its product will
depend on the velocity of its working parts, on the speed, for instance, of the
spindles, or on the number of blows given by the hammer in a minute. Many of
these colossal hammers strike seventy times in a minute, and Ryder’s patent
machine for forging spindles with small hammers gives as many as 700 strokes
per minute. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a26"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Given the
rate at which machinery transfers its value to the product, the amount of value
so transferred depends on the total value of the machinery.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn514" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref514"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">26</span></a> The less labour it contains, the less
value it imparts to the product. The less value it gives up, so much the more
productive it is, and so much the more its services approximate to those of
natural forces. But the production of machinery by machinery lessens its value
relatively to its extension and efficacy. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An analysis
and comparison of the prices of commodities produced by handicrafts or
manufactures, and of the prices of the same commodities produced by machinery,
shows generally, that, in the product of machinery, the value due to the
instruments of labour increases relatively, but decreases absolutely. In other
words, its absolute amount decreases, but its amount, relatively to the total
value of the product, of a pound of yarn, for instance, increases.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn515" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref515"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">27</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is
evident that whenever it costs as much labour to produce a machine as is saved
by the employment of that machine, there is nothing but a transposition of
labour; consequently the total labour required to produce a commodity is not lessened
or the productiveness of labour is not increased. It is clear, however, that
the difference between the labour a machine costs, and the labour it saves, in
other words, that the degree of its productiveness does not depend on the
difference between its own value and the value of the implement it replaces. As
long as the labour spent on a machine, and consequently the portion of its
value added to the product, remains smaller than the value added by the workman
to the product with his tool, there is always a difference of labour saved in
favour of the machine. The productiveness of a machine is therefore measured by
the human labour-power it replaces. According to Mr. Baynes, 2 operatives are
required for the 450 mule spindles, inclusive of preparation machinery,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn516" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref516"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">28</span></a> that are driven by one-horse power; each
self-acting mule spindle, working ten hours, produces 13 ounces of yarn
(average number of thickness); consequently 2½ operatives spin weekly 365 5/8
lbs. of yarn. Hence, leaving waste on one side, 366 lbs. of cotton absorb,
during their conversion into yarn, only 150 hours’ labour, or fifteen days’
labour of ten hours each. But with a spinning-wheel, supposing the hand-spinner
to produce thirteen ounces of yarn in sixty hours, the same weight of cotton
would absorb 2,700 days’ labour of ten hours each, or 27,000 hours’ labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn517" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref517"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">29</span></a> Where blockprinting, the old method of
printing calico by hand, has been superseded by machine printing, a single
machine prints, with the aid of one man or boy, as much calico of four colours
in one hour, as it formerly took 200 men to do.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn518" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref518"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">30</span></a>
Before Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793, the separation of the seed
from a pound of cotton cost an average day’s labour. By means of his invention
one negress was enabled to clean 100 lbs. daily; and since then, the efficacy
of the gin has been considerably increased. A pound of cotton wool, previously
costing 50 cents to produce, included after that invention more unpaid labour,
and was consequently sold with greater profit, at 10 cents. In India they
employ for separating the wool from the seed, an instrument, half machine, half
tool, called a churka; with this one man and a woman can clean 28 lbs. daily.
With the churka invented some years ago by Dr. Forbes, one man and a boy produce
250 lbs. daily. If oxen, steam, or water, be used for driving it, only a few
boys and girls as feeders are required. Sixteen of these machines driven by
oxen do as much work in a day as formerly 750 people did on an average.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn519" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref519"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">31</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As already
stated, a steam-plough does as much work in one hour at a cost of three-pence,
as 66 men at a cost of 15 shillings. I return to this example in order to clear
up an erroneous notion. The 15 shillings are by no means the expression in
money of all the labour expended in one hour by the 66 men. If the ratio of
surplus labour to necessary labour were 100%, these 66 men would produce in one
hour a value of 30 shillings, although their wages, 15 shillings, represent
only their labour for half an hour. Suppose, then, a machine cost as much as
the wages for a year of the 150 men it displaces, say £3,000; this £3,000 is by
no means the expression in money of the labour added to the object produced by
these 150 men before the introduction of the machine, but only of that portion
of their year’s labour which was expended for themselves and represented by
their wages. On the other hand, the £3,000, the money-value of the machine,
expresses all the labour expended on its production, no matter in what
proportion this labour constitutes wages for the workman, and surplus-value for
the capitalist. Therefore, though a machine cost as much as the labour-power
displaced by it costs, yet the labour materialised in it is even then much less
than the living labour it replaces. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn520" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref520"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">32</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The use of
machinery for the exclusive purpose of cheapening the product, is limited in
this way, that less labour must be expended in producing the machinery than is
displaced by the employment of that machinery, For the capitalist, however,
this use is still more limited. Instead of paying for the labour, he only pays
the value of the labour-power employed; therefore, the limit to his using a
machine is fixed by the difference between the value of the machine and the
value of the labour-power replaced by it. Since the division of the day’s work
into necessary and surplus labour differs in different countries, and even in
the same country at different periods, or in different branches of industry;
and further, since the actual wage of the labourer at one time sinks below the
value of his labour-power, at another rises above it, it is possible for the
difference between the price of the machinery and the price of the labour-power
replaced by that machinery to vary very much, although the difference between
the quantity of labour requisite to produce the machine and the total quantity
replaced by it, remain constant.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn521" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref521"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">33</span></a> But it
is the former difference alone that determines the cost, to the capitalist, of
producing a commodity, and, through the pressure of competition, influences his
action. Hence the invention now-a-days of machines in England that are employed
only in North America; just as in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
machines were invented in Germany to be used only in Holland, and just as many
a French invention of the eighteenth century was exploited in England alone. In
the older countries, machinery, when employed in some branches of industry,
creates such a redundancy of labour in other branches that in these latter the
fall of wages below the value of labour-power impedes the use of machinery,
and, from the standpoint of the capitalist, whose profit comes, not from a
diminution of the labour employed, but of the labour paid for, renders that use
superfluous and often impossible. In some branches of the woollen manufacture
in England the employment of children has during recent years been considerably
diminished, and in some cases has been entirely abolished. Why? Because the
Factory Acts made two sets of children necessary, one working six hours, the other
four, or each working five hours. But the parents refused to sell the
“half-timers” cheaper than the “full-timers.” Hence the substitution of
machinery for the “half-timers.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn522" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref522"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">34</span></a> Before
the labour of women and of children under 10 years of age was forbidden in
mines, capitalists considered the employment of naked women and girls, often in
company with men, so far sanctioned by their moral code, and especially by
their ledgers, that it was only after the passing of the Act that they had
recourse to machinery. The Yankees have invented a stone-breaking machine. The
English do not make use of it, because the “wretch” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn523" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref523"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">35</span></a>who does this work gets paid for such a
small portion of his labour, that machinery would increase the cost of
production to the capitalist.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn524" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref524"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span> In England women are still occasionally used

because the labour required to produce horses and machines is an accurately
known quantity, while that required to maintain the women of the
surplus-population is below all calculation. Hence nowhere do we find a more
shameful squandering of human labour-power for the most despicable purposes
than in England, the land of machinery. </span></p>

Workman</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
starting-point of modern industry is, as we have shown, the revolution in the
instruments of labour, and this revolution attains its most highly developed
form in the organised system of machinery in a factory. Before we inquire how
human material is incorporated with this objective organism, let us consider
some general effects of this revolution on the labourer himself.</span></p>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">A. Appropriation of Supplementary
Labour-Power by Capital. The Employment of Women and Children</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In so far as machinery dispenses with muscular
power, it becomes a means of employing labourers of slight muscular strength,
and those whose bodily development is incomplete, but whose limbs are all the
more supple. The labour of women and children was, therefore, the first thing
sought for by capitalists who used machinery. That mighty substitute for labour
and labourers was forthwith changed into a means for increasing the number of
wage-labourers by enrolling, under the direct sway of capital, every member of
the workman’s family, without distinction of age or sex. Compulsory work for
the capitalist usurped the place, not only of the children’s play, but also of
free labour at home within moderate limits for the support of the family.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn526" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref526"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">38</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The value of labour-power was determined, not
only by the labour-time necessary to maintain the individual adult labourer,
but also by that necessary to maintain his family. Machinery, by throwing every
member of that family on to the labour-market, spreads the value of the man’s
labour-power over his whole family. It thus depreciates his labour-power. To
purchase the labour-power of a family of four workers may, perhaps, cost more
than it formerly did to purchase the labour-power of the head of the family,
but, in return, four days’ labour takes the place of one, and their price falls
in proportion to the excess of the surplus labour of four over the surplus
labour of one. In order that the family may live, four people must now, not
only labour, but expend surplus labour for the capitalist. Thus we see, that
machinery, while augmenting the human material that forms the principal object
of capital’s exploiting power,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn527" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref527"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">39</span></a> at the
same time raises the degree of exploitation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Machinery also revolutionises out and out the
contract between the labourer and the capitalist, which formally fixes their
mutual relations. Taking the exchange of commodities as our basis, our first
assumption was that capitalist and labourer met as free persons, as independent
owners of commodities; the one possessing money and means of production, the
other labour-power. But now the capitalist buys children and young persons
under age. Previously, the workman sold his own labour-power, which he disposed
of nominally as a free agent. Now he sells wife and child. He has become a
slave-dealer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn528" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref528"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">40</span></a> The demand for children’s
labour often resembles in form the inquiries for negro slaves, such as were
formerly to be read among the advertisements in American journals.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“My
attention,” says an English factory inspector, “was drawn to an advertisement
in the local paper of one of the most important manufacturing towns of my
district, of which the following is a copy: Wanted, 12 to 20 young persons, not
younger than what can pass for 13 years. Wages, 4 shillings a week. Apply
&amp;c.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn529" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref529"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">41</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The phrase “what can pass for 13 years,” has
reference to the fact, that by the Factory Act, children under 13 years may
work only 6 hours. A surgeon officially appointed must certify their age. The
manufacturer, therefore, asks for children who look as if they were already 13
years old. The decrease, often by leaps and bounds in the number of children
under 13 years employed in factories, a decrease that is shown in an
astonishing manner by the English statistics of the last 20 years, was for the
most part, according to the evidence of the factory inspectors themselves, the
work of the certifying surgeons, who overstated the age of the children,
agreeably to the capitalist’s greed for exploitation, and the sordid
trafficking needs of the parents. In the notorious district of Bethnal Green, a
public market is held every Monday and Tuesday morning, where children of both
sexes from 9 years of age upwards, hire themselves out to the silk
manufacturers. "The usual terms are 1s. 8d. a week (this belongs to the
parents) and ‘2d. for myself and tea.’ The contract is binding only for the
week. The scene and language while this market is going on are quite
disgraceful.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn530" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref530"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">42</span></a> It has also occurred in
England, that women have taken “children from the workhouse and let any one
have them out for 2s. 6d. a week.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn531" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref531"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">43</span></a>
In spite of legislation, the number of boys sold in Great Britain by their
parents to act as live chimney-sweeping machines (although there exist plenty
of machines to replace them) exceeds 2,000.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn532" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref532"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">44</span></a>
The revolution effected by machinery in the juridical relations between the
buyer and the seller of labour-power, causing the transaction as a whole to
lose the appearance of a contract between free persons, afforded the English
Parliament an excuse, founded on juridical principles, for the interference of
the state with factories. Whenever the law limits the labour of children to 6
hours in industries not before interfered with, the complaints of the
manufacturers are always renewed. They allege that numbers of the parents
withdraw their children from the industry brought under the Act, in order to
sell them where “freedom of labour” still rules, i.e., where children under 13
years are compelled to work like grown-up people, and therefore can be got rid
of at a higher price. But since capital is by nature a leveller, since it
exacts in every sphere of production equality in the conditions of the
exploitation of labour, the limitation by law of children’s labour, in one
branch of industry, becomes the cause of its limitation in others. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We have already alluded to the physical
deterioration as well of the children and young-persons as of the women, whom
machinery, first directly in the factories that shoot up on its basis, and then
indirectly in all the remaining branches of industry, subjects to the
exploitation of capital. In this place, therefore, we dwell only on one point,
the enormous mortality, during the first few years of their life, of the
children of the operatives. In sixteen of the registration districts into which
England is divided, there are, for every 100,000 children alive under the age
of one year, only 9,000 deaths in a year on an average (in one district only
7,047); in 24 districts the deaths are over 10,000, but under 11,000; in 39
districts, over 11,000, but under 12,000; in 48 districts over 12,000, but
under 13,000; in 22 districts over 20,000; in 25 districts over 21,000; in 17
over 22,000; in 11 over 23,000; in Hoo, Wolverhampton, Ashton-under-Lyne, and
Preston, over 24,000; in Nottingham, Stockport, and Bradford, over 25,000; in
Wisbeach, 16,000; and in Manchester, 26,125.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn533" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref533"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">45</span></a>
As was shown by an official medical inquiry in the year 1861, the high
death-rates are, apart from local causes, principally due to the employment of
the mothers away from their homes, and to the neglect and maltreatment, consequent
on her absence, such as, amongst others, insufficient nourishment, unsuitable
food, and dosing with opiates; besides this, there arises an unnatural
estrangement between mother and child, and as a consequence intentional
starving and poisoning of the children.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn534" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref534"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">46</span></a>
In those agricultural districts, “where a minimum in the employment of women
exists, the death-rate is on the other hand very low.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn535" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref535"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">47</span></a> The Inquiry Commission of 1861 led,
however, to the unexpected result, that in some purely agricultural districts
bordering on the North Sea, the death-rate of children under one year old
almost equalled that of the worst factory districts. Dr. Julian Hunter was
therefore commissioned to investigate this phenomenon on the spot. His report
is incorporated with the “Sixth Report on Public Health.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn536" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref536"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">48</span></a> Up to that time it was supposed, that the
children were decimated by malaria, and other diseases peculiar to low-lying
and marshy districts. But the inquiry showed the very opposite, namely, that
the same cause which drove away malaria, the conversion of the land, from a
morass in winter and a scanty pasture in summer, into fruitful corn land,
created the exceptional death-rate of the infants.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn537" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref537"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">49</span></a> The 70 medical men, whom Dr. Hunter
examined in that district, were “wonderfully in accord” on this point. In fact,
the revolution in the mode of cultivation had led to the introduction of the
industrial system. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Married women, who work in gangs along with boys
and girls, are, for a stipulated sum of money, placed at the disposal of the
farmer, by a man called the “undertaker,” who contracts for the whole gang.
“These gangs will sometimes travel many miles from their own village; they are
to be met morning and evening on the roads, dressed in short petticoats, with
suitable coats and boots, and sometimes trousers, looking wonderfully strong
and healthy, but tainted with a customary immorality and heedless of the fatal
results which their love of this busy and independent life is bringing on their
unfortunate offspring who are pining at home.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn538" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref538"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">50</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“My knowledge
of such evils,” says Dr. Simon, the medical officer of the Privy Council and

misgiving with which I regard any large industrial employment of adult women.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn540" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref540"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">52</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“Happy indeed,” exclaims Mr. Baker, the factory
inspector, in his official report, “happy indeed will it be for the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The moral degradation caused by the capitalistic
exploitation of women and children has been so exhaustively depicted by F.
Engels in his “Lage der Arbeitenden Klasse Englands,” and other writers, that I
need only mention the subject in this place. But the intellectual desolation
artificially produced by converting immature human beings into mere machines
for the fabrication of surplus-value, a state of mind clearly distinguishable
from that natural ignorance which keeps the mind fallow without destroying its
capacity for development, its natural fertility, this desolation finally
compelled even the English Parliament to make elementary education a compulsory
condition to the “productive” employment of children under 14 years, in every
industry subject to the Factory Acts. The spirit of capitalist production
stands out clearly in the ludicrous wording of the so-called education clauses
in the Factory Acts, in the absence of an administrative machinery, an absence
that again makes the compulsion illusory, in the opposition of the
manufacturers themselves to these education clauses, and in the tricks and dodges
they put in practice for evading them.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“For this the
legislature is alone to blame, by having passed a delusive law, which, while it
would seem to provide that the children employed in factories shall be <i class="calibre4">educated,
</i>contains no enactment by which that professed end can be secured. It
provides nothing more than that the children shall on certain days of the week,
and for a certain number of hours (three) in each day, be inclosed within the
four walls of a place called a school, and that the employer of the child shall
receive weekly a certificate to that effect signed by a person designated by
the subscriber as a schoolmaster or schoolmistress.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn542" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref542"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">54</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Previous to the passing of the amended Factory
Act, 1844, it happened, not unfrequently, that the certificates of attendance
at school were signed by the schoolmaster or schoolmistress with a cross, as
they themselves were unable to write.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“On one
occasion, on visiting a place called a school, from which certificates of
school attendance, had issued, I was so struck with the ignorance of the
master, that I said to him: ‘Pray, sir, can you read?’ His reply was: ‘Aye,
summat!’ and as a justification of his right to grant certificates, he added:
‘At any rate, I am before my scholars.’” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The inspectors, when the Bill of 1844 was in
preparation, did not fail to represent the disgraceful state of the places
called schools, certificates from which they were obliged to admit as a
compliance with the laws, but they were successful only in obtaining thus much,
that since the passing of the Act of 1845, </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">the figures

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Sir John Kincaid, factory inspector for

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The first
school we visited was kept by a Mrs. Ann Killin. Upon asking her to spell her
name, she straightway made a mistake, by beginning with the letter C, but
correcting herself immediately, she said her name began with a K. On looking at
her signature, however, in the school certificate books, I noticed that she
spelt it in various ways, while her handwriting left no doubt as to her
unfitness to teach. She herself also acknowledged that she could not keep the
register ... In a second school I found the schoolroom 15 feet long, and 10
feet wide, and counted in this space 75 children, who were gabbling something
unintelligible”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn544" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref544"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">56</span></a> But it
is not only in the miserable places above referred to that the children obtain
certificates of school attendance without having received instruction of any
value, for in many schools where there is a competent teacher, his efforts are
of little avail from the distracting crowd of children of all ages, from
infants of 3 years old and upwards; his livelihood, miserable at the best,
depending on the pence received from the greatest number of children whom it is
possible to cram into the space. To this is to be added scanty school
furniture, deficiency of books, and other materials for teaching, and the
depressing effect upon the poor children themselves of a close, noisome
atmosphere. I have been in many such schools, where I have seen rows of
children doing absolutely nothing; and this is certified as school attendance,
and, in statistical returns, such children are set down as being educated.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn545" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref545"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">57</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Horribly grotesque does this appear in print
works, which are regulated by a special Act. By that Act,</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“every child,
before being employed in a print work must have attended school for at least 30
days, and not less than 150 hours, during the six months immediately preceding
such first day of employment, and during the continuance of its employment in
the print works, it must attend for a like period of 30 days, and 150 hours
during every successive period of six months.... The attendance at school must
be between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. No attendance of less than 2½ hours, nor more than
5 hours on any one day, shall be reckoned as part of the 150 hours. Under
ordinary circumstances the children attend school morning and afternoon for 30
days, for at least 5 hours each day, and upon the expiration of the 30 days,
the statutory total of 150 hours having been attained, having, in their
language, made up their book, they return to the print work, where they
continue until the six months have expired, when another instalment of school
attendance becomes due, and they again seek the school until the book is again
made up.... Many boys having attended school for the required number of hours,
when they return to school after the expiration of their six months’ work in
the print work, are in the same condition as when they first attended school as
print-work boys, that they have lost all they gained by their previous school
attendance.... In other print works the children’s attendance at school is made
to depend altogether upon the exigencies of the work in the establishment. The
requisite number of hours is made up each six months, by instalments consisting
of from 3 to 5 hours at a time, spreading over, perhaps, the whole six
months.... For instance, the attendance on one day might be from 8 to 11 a.m.,
on another day from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., and the child might not appear at school
again for several days, when it would attend from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.; then it
might attend for 3 or 4 days consecutively, or for a week, then it would not
appear in school for 3 weeks or a month, after that upon some odd days at some
odd hours when the operative who employed it chose to spare it; and thus the
child was, as it were, buffeted from school to work, from work to school, until
the tale of 150 hours was told.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn547" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref547"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">59</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By the excessive addition of women and children

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">B. Prolongation of the Working day</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If
machinery be the most powerful means for increasing the productiveness of
labour – i.e., for shortening the working-time required in the production of a
commodity, it becomes in the hands of capital the most powerful means, in those
industries first invaded by it, for lengthening the working day beyond all bounds
set by human nature. It creates, on the one hand, new conditions by which
capital is enabled to give free scope to this its constant tendency, and on the
other hand, new motives with which to whet capital’s appetite for the labour of
others. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
first place, in the form of machinery, the implements of labour become
automatic, things moving and working independent of the workman. They are
thenceforth an industrial <em class="calibre4">perpetuum mobile</em>, that would go on producing
forever, did it not meet with certain natural obstructions in the weak bodies
and the strong wills of its human attendants. The automaton, as capital, and
because it is capital, is endowed, in the person of the capitalist, with
intelligence and will; it is therefore animated by the longing to reduce to a
minimum the resistance offered by that repellent yet elastic natural barrier,
man.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn549" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref549"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">61</span></a> This resistance is moreover lessened by
the apparent lightness of machine work, and by the more pliant and docile
character of the women and children employed on it.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn550" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref550"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">62</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
productiveness of machinery is, as we saw, inversely proportional to the value
transferred by it to the product. The longer the life of the machine, the
greater is the mass of the products over which the value transmitted by the
machine is spread, and the less is the portion of that value added to each
single commodity. The active lifetime of a machine is, however, clearly
dependent on the length of the working day, or on the duration of the daily
labour-process multiplied by the number of days for which the process is
carried on. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The wear
and tear of a machine is not exactly proportional to its working-time. And even
if it were so, a machine working 16 hours daily for 7½ years, covers as long a
working period as, and transmits to the total product no more value than, the
same machine would if it worked only 8 hours daily for 15 years. But in the
first case the value of the machine would be reproduced twice as quickly as in
the latter, and the capitalist would, by this use of the machine, absorb in 7½
years as much surplus-value as in the second case he would in 15. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
material wear and tear of a machine is of two kinds. The one arises from use,
as coins wear away by circulating, the other from non-use, as a sword rusts
when left in its scabbard. The latter kind is due to the elements. The former
is more or less directly proportional, the latter to a certain extent inversely
proportional, to the use of the machine.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn551" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref551"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">63</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But in
addition to the material wear and tear, a machine also undergoes, what we may
call a moral depreciation. It loses exchange-value, either by machines of the
same sort being produced cheaper than it, or by better machines entering into
competition with it.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn552" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref552"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">64</span></a> In both
cases, be the machine ever so young and full of life, its value is no longer
determined by the labour actually materialised in it, but by the labour-time
requisite to reproduce either it or the better machine. It has, therefore, lost
value more or less. The shorter the period taken to reproduce its total value,
the less is the danger of moral depreciation; and the longer the working day,
the shorter is that period. When machinery is first introduced into an
industry, new methods of reproducing it more cheaply follow blow upon blow<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn553" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref553"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">65</span></a>, and so do improvements, that not only
affect individual parts and details of the machine, but its entire build. It
is, therefore, in the early days of the life of machinery that this special
incentive to the prolongation of the working day makes itself felt most
acutely.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn554" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref554"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">66</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a68"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a67"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Given the
length of the working day, all other circumstances remaining the same, the
exploitation of double the number of workmen demands, not only a doubling of
that part of constant capital which is invested in machinery and buildings, but
also of that part which is laid out in raw material and auxiliary substances.
The lengthening of the working day, on the other hand, allows of production on
an extended scale without any alteration in the amount of capital laid out on
machinery and buildings.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn555" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref555"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">67</span></a> Not only
is there, therefore, an increase of surplus-value, but the outlay necessary to
obtain it diminishes. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a69"></a>It is true that this takes place, more or
less, with every lengthening of the working day; but in the case under
consideration, the change is more marked, because the capital converted into
the instruments of labour preponderates to a greater degree. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn556" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref556"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">68</span></a> The development of the factory system
fixes a constantly increasing portion of the capital in a form, in which, on
the one hand, its value is capable of continual self-expansion, and in which,
on the other hand, it loses both use-value and exchange-value whenever it loses
contact with living labour. “When a labourer,” said <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a70"></a>Mr.
Ashworth, a cotton magnate, to Professor Nassau W. Senior, “lays down his
spade, he renders useless, for that period, a capital worth eighteen-pence.
When one of our people leaves the mill, he renders useless a capital that has
cost £100,000.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn557" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref557"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">69</span></a> Only
fancy! making “useless” for a single moment, a capital that has cost £100,000!
It is, in truth, monstrous, that a single one of our people should ever leave

received from Ashworth clearly perceives, makes a constantly increasing
lengthening of the working day “desirable.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn558" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref558"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">70</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Machinery
produces relative surplus-value; not only by directly depreciating the value of
labour-power, and by indirectly cheapening the same through cheapening the
commodities that enter into its reproduction, but also, when it is first
introduced sporadically into an industry, by converting the labour employed by
the owner of that machinery, into labour of a higher degree and greater
efficacy, by raising the social value of the article produced above its
individual value, and thus enabling the capitalist to replace the value of a
day’s labour-power by a smaller portion of the value of a day’s product. During
this transition period, when the use of machinery is a sort of monopoly, the
profits are therefore exceptional, and the capitalist endeavours to exploit thoroughly
“the sunny time of this his first love,” by prolonging the working day as much
as possible. The magnitude of the profit whets his appetite for more profit. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As the use
of machinery becomes more general in a particular industry, the social value of
the product sinks down to its individual value, and the law that surplus-value
does not arise from the labour-power that has been replaced by the machinery,
but from the labour-power actually employed in working with the machinery,
asserts itself. Surplus-value arises from variable capital alone, and we saw
that the amount of surplus-value depends on two factors, viz., the rate of surplus-value
and the number of the workmen simultaneously employed. Given the length of the
working day, the rate of surplus-value is determined by the relative duration
of the necessary labour and of the surplus labour in a day. The number of the
labourers simultaneously employed depends, on its side, on the ratio of the
variable to the constant capital. Now, however much the use of machinery may
increase the surplus labour at the expense of the necessary labour by
heightening the productiveness of labour, it is clear that it attains this
result, only by diminishing the number of workmen employed by a given amount of
capital. It converts what was formerly variable capital, invested in
labour-power, into machinery which, being constant capital, does not produce surplus-value.
It is impossible, for instance, to squeeze as much surplus-value out of 2 as
out of 24 labourers. If each of these 24 men gives only one hour of surplus
labour in 12, the 24 men give together 24 hours of surplus labour, while 24
hours is the total labour of the two men. Hence, the application of machinery
to the production of surplus-value implies a contradiction which is immanent in
it, since of the two factors of the surplus-value created by a given amount of
capital, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a71"></a>one, the rate of surplus-value, cannot be increased,
except by diminishing the other, the number of workmen. This contradiction
comes to light, as soon as by the general employment of machinery in a given
industry, the value of the machine-produced commodity regulates the value of
all commodities of the same sort; and it is this contradiction, that in its
turn, drives the capitalist, without his being conscious of the fact,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn559" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref559"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">71</span></a> to excessive lengthening of the working
day, in order that he may compensate the decrease in the relative number of
labourers exploited, by an increase not only of the relative, but of the
absolute surplus labour. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a72"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If, then,
the capitalistic employment of machinery, on the one hand, supplies new and
powerful motives to an excessive lengthening of the working day, and radically
changes, as well the methods of labour, as also the character of the social
working organism, in such a manner as to break down all opposition to this
tendency, on the other hand it produces, partly by opening out to the
capitalist new strata of the working-class, previously inaccessible to him,
partly by setting free the labourers it supplants, a surplus working
population,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn560" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref560"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">72</span></a> which is compelled to
submit to the dictation of capital. Hence that remarkable phenomenon in the
history of modern industry, that machinery sweeps away every moral and natural
restriction on the length of the working day. Hence, too, the economic paradox,
that the most powerful instrument for shortening labour-time, becomes the most
unfailing means for placing every moment of the labourer’s <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a73"></a>time
and that of his family, at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of
expanding the value of his capital. “If,” dreamed Aristotle, the greatest
thinker of antiquity, “if every tool, when summoned, or even of its own accord,
could do the work that befits it, just as the creations of Daedalus moved of
themselves, or the tripods of Hephaestos went of their own accord to their
sacred work, if the weavers’ shuttles were to weave of themselves, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a74"></a>then
there would be no need either of apprentices for the master workers, or of
slaves for the lords.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn561" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref561"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">73</span></a>And
Antipatros, a Greek poet of the time of Cicero, hailed the invention of the
water-wheel for grinding corn, an invention that is the elementary form of all
machinery, as the giver of freedom to female slaves, and the bringer back of
the golden age.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn562" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref562"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">74</span></a> Oh!
those heathens! They understood, as the learned Bastiat, and before him the
still wiser MacCulloch have discovered, nothing of Political Economy and
Christianity. They did not, for example, comprehend that machinery is the
surest means of lengthening the working day. They perhaps excused the slavery
of one on the ground that it was a means to the full development of another.
But to preach slavery of the masses, in order that a few crude and
half-educated parvenus, might become “eminent spinners,” “extensive
sausage-makers,” and “influential shoe-black dealers,” to do this, they lacked
the bump of Christianity. </span></p>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">C. Intensification of Labour</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The immoderate lengthening of the working day,
produced by machinery in the hands of capital, leads to a reaction on the part
of society, the very sources of whose life are menaced; and, thence, to a
normal working day whose length is fixed by law. Thenceforth a phenomenon that
we have already met with, namely, the intensification of labour, develops into
great importance. Our analysis of absolute surplus-value had reference
primarily to the extension or duration of the labour, its intensity being
assumed as given. We now proceed to consider the substitution of a more
intensified labour for labour of more extensive duration, and the degree of the
former. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is self-evident, that in proportion as the
use of machinery spreads, and the experience of a special class of workmen
habituated to machinery accumulates, the rapidity and intensity of labour
increase as a natural consequence. Thus in England, during half a century,
lengthening of the working day went hand in hand with increasing intensity of
factory labour. Nevertheless the reader will clearly see, that where we have
labour, not carried on by fits and starts, but repeated day after day with
unvarying uniformity, a point must inevitably be reached, where extension of
the working day and intensity of the labour mutually exclude one another, in
such a way that lengthening of the working day becomes compatible only with a
lower degree of intensity, and a higher degree of intensity, only with a
shortening of the working day. So soon as the gradually surging revolt of the
working-class compelled Parliament to shorten compulsorily the hours of labour,
and to begin by imposing a normal working day on factories proper, so soon
consequently as an increased production of surplus-value by the prolongation of
the working day was once for all put a stop to, from that moment capital threw
itself with all its might into the production of relative surplus-value, by
hastening on the further improvement of machinery. At the same time a change
took place in the nature of relative surplus-value. Generally speaking, the
mode of producing relative surplus-value consists in raising the productive
power of the workman, so as to enable him to produce more in a given time with
the same expenditure of labour. Labour-time continues to transmit as before the
same value to the total product, but this unchanged amount of exchange-value is
spread over more use-value; hence the value of each single commodity sinks.
Otherwise, however, so soon as the compulsory shortening of the hours of labour
takes place. The immense impetus it gives the development of productive power,
and to economy in the means of production, imposes on the workman increased
expenditure of labour in a given time, heightened <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a75"></a>tension of
labour-power, and closer filling up of the pores of the working day, or
condensation of labour to a degree that is attainable only within the limits of
the shortened working day. This condensation of a greater mass of labour into a
given period thenceforward counts for what it really is, a greater quantity of
labour. In addition to a measure of its extension, i.e., duration, labour now
acquires a measure of its intensity or of the degree of its condensation or
density.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn563" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref563"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">75</span></a> The denser hour of the ten
hours’ working day contains more labour, i.e., expended labour-power than the
more porous hour of the twelve hours’ working day. The product therefore of one
of the former hours has as much or more value than has the product of 1 1/5 of
the latter hours. Apart from the increased yield of relative surplus-value
through the heightened productiveness of labour, the same mass of value is now
produced for the capitalist say by 3 1/3 hours of surplus labour, and 6 2/3 hours
of necessary labour, as was previously produced by four hours of surplus labour
and eight hours of necessary labour. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We now come to the question: How is the labour
intensified? <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a77"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a76"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The first effect of shortening the working day
results from the self-evident law, that the efficiency of labour-power is in an
inverse ratio to the duration of its expenditure. Hence, within certain limits
what is lost by shortening the duration is gained by the increasing tension of
labour-power. That the workman moreover really does expend more labour-power,
is ensured by the mode in which the capitalist pays him.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn564" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref564"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">76</span></a> In those industries, such as potteries,
where machinery plays little or no part, the introduction of the Factory Acts
has strikingly shown that the mere shortening of the working day increases to a
wonderful degree the regularity, uniformity, order, continuity, and energy of
the labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn565" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref565"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">77</span></a> It seemed, however,
doubtful whether this effect was produced in the factory proper, where the
dependence of the workman on the continuous and uniform motion of the machinery
had already created the <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a78"></a>strictest discipline. Hence, when in
1844 the reduction of the working day to less than twelve hours was being
debated, the masters almost unanimously declared</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“that their
overlookers in the different rooms took good care that the hands lost no time,”
<a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a79"></a>that “the extent of vigilance and attention on the part of the
workmen was hardly capable of being increased,” and, therefore, that the speed
of the machinery and other conditions remaining unaltered, “to expect in a
well-managed factory any important result from increased attention of the
workmen was an absurdity.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn566" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref566"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">78</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This assertion was contradicted by experiments.
Mr. Robert Gardner reduced the hours of labour in his two large factories at
Preston, on and after the 20th April, 1844, from twelve to eleven hours a day.
The result of about a year’s working was that “the same amount of product for
the same cost was <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a80"></a>received, and the workpeople as a whole
earned in eleven hours as much wages as they did before in twelve.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn567" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref567"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">79</span></a> I pass over the experiments made in the
spinning and carding rooms, because they were accompanied by an increase of 2%
in the speed of the machines. But in the weaving department, where, moreover,
many sorts of figured fancy articles were woven, there was not the slightest
alteration in the conditions of the work. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a81"></a>The result was: “From
6th January to 20th April, 1844, with a twelve hours’ day, average weekly wages
of each hand 10s. 1½d., from 20th April to 29th June, 1844, with day of eleven
hours, average weekly wages 10s. 3½d.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn568" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref568"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">80</span></a>
Here we have more produced in eleven hours than previously in twelve, and
entirely in consequence of more steady application and economy of time by the
workpeople. While they got the same wages and gained one hour of spare time,
the capitalist got the same amount produced and saved the cost of coal, gas,
and other such items, for one hour. Similar experiments, and with the like
success, were carried out in the mills of Messrs. Horrocks and Jacson.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn569" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref569"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">81</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The shortening of the hours of labour creates,
to begin with, the subjective conditions for the condensation of labour, by
enabling the workman to exert more strength in a given time. So soon as that
shortening becomes compulsory, machinery becomes in the hands of capital the
objective means, systematically employed for squeezing out more labour in a
given time. This is effected in two ways: by increasing the speed of the
machinery, and by giving the workman more machinery to tent. Improved
construction of the machinery is necessary, partly because without it greater
pressure cannot be put on the workman, and partly because the shortened hours
of labour force the capitalist to exercise the strictest watch over the cost of
production. The improvements in the steam-engine have increased the piston
speed, and at the same time have made it possible, by means of a greater
economy of power, to drive with the same or even a smaller consumption of coal
more machinery with the same engine. The improvements in the transmitting
mechanism have lessened friction, and, what so strikingly distinguishes modern
from the older machinery, have reduced the diameter and weight of the shafting
to a constantly decreasing minimum. Finally, the improvements in the operative
machines have, while reducing their size, increased their speed and efficiency,
as in the modern power-loom; or, while increasing the size of their framework,
have also increased the extent and number of their working parts, as in
spinning-mules, or have added to the speed of these working parts by
imperceptible alterations of detail, such as those which ten years ago
increased the speed of the spindles in self-acting mules by one-fifth. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a82"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The reduction of the working day to 12 hours
dates in England from 1832. In 1836 a manufacturer stated:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The labour
now undergone in the factories is much greater than it used to be ... compared
with thirty or forty years ago ... owing to the greater attention and activity
required by the greatly increased speed which is given to the machinery.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn570" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref570"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">82</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the year 1844, Lord Ashley, now Lord
Shaftesbury, made in the House of Commons the following statements, supported
by documentary evidence:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The labour
performed by those engaged in the processes of manufacture, is three times as
great as in the beginning of such operations. Machinery has executed, no doubt,
the work that would demand the sinews of millions of men; but it has also
prodigiously multiplied the labour of those who are governed by its fearful
movements.... In 1815, the labour of following a pair of mules spinning cotton
of No. 40 – reckoning 12 hours to the working day – involved a necessity of
walking 8 miles. In 1832, the distance travelled in following a pair of mules,
spinning cotton yarn of the same number, was 20 miles, and frequently more. In
1835” (query – 1815 or 1825?) “the spinner put up daily, on each of these
mules, 820 stretches, making a total of 1,640 stretches in the course of the
day. In 1832, the spinner put up on each mule 2,200 stretches, making a total
of 4,400. In 1844, 2,400 stretches, making a total of 4,800; and in some cases
the amount of labour required is even still greater.... I have another document
sent to me in 1842, stating that the labour is progressively increasing -
increasing not only because the distance to be travelled is greater, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a83"></a>but because the quantity of goods produced is multiplied, while
the hands are fewer in proportion than before; and, moreover, because an
inferior species of cotton is now often spun, which it is more difficult to work....
In the carding-room there has also been a great increase of labour. One person
there does the work formerly divided between two. In the weaving-room, where a
vast number of persons are employed, and principally females ... the labour has
increased within the last few years fully 10 per cent., owing to the increased
speed of the machinery in spinning. In 1838, the number of hanks spun per week
was 18,000, in 1843 it amounted to 21,000. In 1819, the number of picks in
power-loom-weaving per minute was 60 – in 1842 it was 140, showing a vast
increase of labour.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn571" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref571"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">83</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the face of this remarkable intensity of
labour which had already been reached in 1844 under the Twelve Hours’ Act,
there appeared to be a justification for the assertion made at that time by the
English manufacturers, that any further progress in that direction was
impossible, and therefore that every further reduction of the hours of labour
meant a lessened production. The apparent correctness of their reasons will be
best shown by the following contemporary statement by Leonard Horner, the
factory inspector, their ever watchful censor.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Now, as the
quantity produced must, in the main, be regulated by the speed of the
machinery, it must be the interest of the mill-owner to drive it at the utmost
rate of speed consistent with these following conditions, viz., the
preservation of the machinery from too rapid deterioration; the preservation of
the quality of the article manufactured; and the capability of the workman to
follow the motion without a greater exertion than he can sustain for a
constancy. One of the most important problems, therefore, which the owner of a
factory has to solve is to find out the maximum speed at which he can run, with
a due regard to the above conditions. It frequently happens that he finds he
has gone too fast, that breakages and bad work more than counterbalance the
increased speed, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a85"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a84"></a>and that he is obliged to
slacken his pace. I therefore concluded, that as an active and intelligent
mill-owner would find out the safe maximum, it would not be possible to produce
as much in eleven hours as in twelve. I further assumed that the operative paid
by piecework, would exert himself to the utmost consistent with the power of
continuing at the same rate.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn572" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref572"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">84</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Horner, therefore, came to the conclusion that a
reduction of the working hours below twelve would necessarily diminish
production.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn573" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref573"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">85</span></a> He himself, ten years
later, cites his opinion of 1845 in proof of how much he under-estimated in
that year the elasticity of machinery, and of man’s labour-power, both of which
are simultaneously stretched to an extreme by the compulsory shortening of the
working day. </span></p>

Patricroft, near Manchester, explained in a letter to Leonard Horner, written
in 1852, the nature of the improvements in the steam-engine that had been made
between the years 1848 and 1852. After remarking that the horse-power of
steam-engines, being always estimated in the official returns according to the
power of similar engines in 1828<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn575" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref575"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">87</span></a>, is only
nominal, and can serve only as an index of their real power, he goes on to say:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“I am
confident that from the same weight of steam-engine machinery, we are now
obtaining at least 50 per cent. more duty or work performed on the average, and
that in many cases the identical steam-engines which in the days of the

yielding upwards of 100...” <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a89"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a88"></a>"The modern

there are fewer hands employed in proportion to the machinery.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn576" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref576"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">88</span></a> “In the year 1850, the factories of the

was respectively 33,503,580 of the former, and 369,205 of the latter, which,
reckoning the force of the nominal horse-power required to be the same as in

is enabled to drive an increased weight of machinery by economy of force and other
methods, and that an increased quantity of work can be turned off by
improvements in machinery, and in methods of manufacture, by increase of speed
of the machinery, and by a variety of other causes.” <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a91"></a><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn578" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref578"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">90</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The great
improvements made in machines of every kind have raised their productive power
very much. Without any doubt, the shortening of the hours of labour... gave the
impulse to these improvements. The latter, combined with the more intense
strain on the workman, have had the effect, that at least as much is produced
in the shortened (by two hours or one-sixth) working day as was previously
produced during the longer one.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn579" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref579"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">91</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One fact is sufficient to show how greatly the
wealth of the manufacturers increased along with the more intense exploitation
of labour-power. From 1838 to 1850, the average proportional increase in
English cotton and other factories was 32%, while from 1850 to 1856 it amounted
to 86%. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But however great the progress of English
industry had been during the 8 years from 1848 to 1856 under the influence of a
working day of 10 hours, it was far surpassed during the next period of 6 years
from 1856 to 1862. In silk factories, for instance, there were in 1856,
spindles 1,093,799; in 1862, 1,388,544; in 1856, looms 9,260; in 1862, 10,709.
But the number of operatives was, in 1856, 56,131; in 1862, 52,429. The
increase in the spindles was therefore 26.9% and in the looms 15.6%, while the
number of the operatives decreased 7%. In the year 1850 there were employed in
worsted mills 875,830 spindles; in 1856, 1,324,549 (increase 51.2%), and in
1862, 1,289,172 (decrease 2.7%). But if we deduct the doubling spindles that
figure in the numbers for 1856, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a92"></a>but not in those for 1862, it
will be found that after 1856 the number of spindles remained nearly
stationary. On the other hand, after 1850, the speed of the spindles and looms
was in many cases doubled. The number of power-looms in worsted mills was, in
1850, 32,617; in 1856, 38,956; in 1862, 43,048. The number of the operatives
was, in 1850, 79,737; in 1856, 87,794; in 1862, 86,063; included in these,
however, the children under 14 years of age were, in 1850, 9,956; in 1856,
11,228; in 1862, 13,178. In spite, therefore, of the greatly increased number
of looms in 1862, compared with 1856, the total number of the workpeople
employed decreased, and that of the children exploited increased.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn580" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref580"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">92</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a93"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the 27th April, 1863, Mr. Ferrand said in the
House of Commons:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“I have been
informed by delegates from 16 districts of Lancashire and Cheshire, in whose
behalf I speak, that the work in the factories is, in consequence of the
improvements in machinery, constantly on the increase. Instead of as formerly
one person with two helps tenting two looms, one person now tents three looms
without helps, and it is no uncommon thing for one person to tent four. Twelve
hours’ work, as is evident from the facts adduced, is now compressed into less
than 10 hours. It is therefore self-evident, to what an enormous extent the
toil of the factory operative has increased during the last 10 years.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn581" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref581"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">93</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a95"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a94"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although, therefore, the Factory Inspectors
unceasingly and with justice, commend the results of the Acts of 1844 and 1850,
yet they admit that the shortening of the hours of labour has already called
forth such an intensification of the labour as is injurious to the health of
the workman and to his capacity for work.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span><span lang="EN-GB">“In most of the cotton, worsted, and silk mills, an exhausting state of
excitement necessary to enable the workers satisfactorily to mind the
machinery, the motion of which has been greatly accelerated within the last few
years, seems to me not unlikely to be one of the causes of that excess of
mortality from lung disease, which Dr. Greenhow has pointed out in his recent
report on this subject.”</span></span><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn582" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref582"><span class="EndnoteCharacters"><span lang="EN-GB">94</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There cannot be the slightest doubt that the
tendency that urges capital, so soon as a prolongation of the hours of labour
is once for all forbidden, to compensate itself, by a systematic heightening of
the intensity of labour, and to convert every improvement in machinery into a
more perfect means of exhausting the workman, must soon lead to <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a96"></a>a
state of things in which a reduction of the hours of labour will again be
inevitable.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn583" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref583"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">95</span></a> On the other hand, the
rapid advance of English industry between 1848 and the present time, under the
influence of a day of 10 hours, surpasses the advance made between 1833 and
1847, when the day was 12 hours long, by far more than the latter surpasses the
advance made during the half century after the first introduction of the
factory system, when the working day was without limits.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_055.htm#_edn584" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref584"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">96</span></a> </span></p>

Factory</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At the commencement of this chapter we
considered that which we may call the body of the factory, i.e., machinery
organised into a system. We there saw how machinery, by annexing the labour of
women and children, augments the number of human beings who form the material
for capitalistic exploitation, how it confiscates the whole of the workman’s
disposable time, by immoderate extension of the hours of labour, and how
finally its progress, which allows of enormous increase of production in
shorter and shorter periods, serves as a means of systematically getting more
work done in a shorter time, or of exploiting labour-power more intensely. We
now turn to the factory as a whole, and that in its most perfect form. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dr. Ure, the Pindar of the automatic factory,
describes it, on the one hand, as</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Combined
co-operation of many orders of workpeople, adult and young, in tending with
assiduous skill, a system of productive machines, continuously impelled by a central
power” (the prime mover); on the other hand, as “a vast automaton, composed of
various mechanical and intellectual organs, acting in uninterrupted concert for
the production of a common object, all of them being subordinate to a
self-regulated moving force.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">These two descriptions are far from being
identical. In one, the collective labourer, or social body of labour, appears
as the dominant subject, and the mechanical automaton as the object; in the
other, the automaton itself is the subject, and the workmen are merely
conscious <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a97"></a>organs, co-ordinate with the unconscious organs of
the automaton, and together with them, subordinated to the central
moving-power. The first description is applicable to every possible employment
of machinery on a large scale, the second is characteristic of its use by
capital, and therefore of the modern factory system. Ure prefers therefore, to
describe the central machine, from which the motion comes, not only as an
automaton, but as an autocrat. “In these spacious halls the benignant power of
steam summons around him his myriads of willing menials.”<a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a98"></a><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn585" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref585"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">97</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Along with the tool, the skill of the workman in
handling it passes over to the machine. The capabilities of the tool are
emancipated from the restraints that are inseparable from human labour-power.
Thereby the technical foundation on which is based the division of labour in
Manufacture, is swept away. Hence, in the place of the hierarchy of specialised
workmen that characterises manufacture, there steps, in the automatic factory,
a tendency to equalise and reduce to one and the same level every kind of work
that has to be done by the minders of the machines;<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn586" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref586"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">98</span></a> in the place of the artificially produced
differentiations of the detail workmen, step the natural differences of age and
sex. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So far as division of labour re-appears in the
factory, it is primarily a distribution of the workmen among the specialised
machines; and of masses of workmen, not however organised into groups, among
the various departments of the factory, in each of which they work at a number
of similar machines placed together; their co-operation, therefore, is only
simple. The organised group, peculiar to manufacture, is replaced by the
connexion between the head workman and his few assistants. The essential
division is, into workmen who are actually employed on the machines (among whom
are included a few who look after the engine), <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a99"></a>and into mere
attendants (almost exclusively children) of these workmen. Among the attendants
are reckoned more or less all “Feeders” who supply the machines with the
material to be worked. In addition to these two principal classes, there is a
numerically unimportant class of persons, whose occupation it is to look after
the whole of the machinery and repair it from time to time; such as engineers,
mechanics, joiners, &amp;c. This is a superior class of workmen, some of them
scientifically educated, others brought up to a trade; it is distinct from the
factory operative class, and merely aggregated to it.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn587" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref587"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">99</span></a> This division of labour is purely
technical. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a102"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a101"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a100"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To work at a machine, the workman should be
taught from childhood, in order that he may learn to adapt his own movements to
the uniform and unceasing motion of an automaton. When the machinery, as a
whole, forms a system of manifold machines, working simultaneously and in
concert, the co-operation based upon it, requires the distribution of various
groups of workmen among the different kinds of machines. But the employment of
machinery does away with the necessity of crystallising this distribution after
the manner of Manufacture, by the constant annexation of a particular man to a
particular function.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn588" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref588"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">100</span></a> Since
the motion of the whole system does not proceed from the workman, but from the
machinery, a change of persons can take place at any time without an
interruption of the work. The most striking proof of this is afforded by the <i class="calibre4">relays
system</i>, put into operation by the manufacturers during their revolt from
1848-1850. Lastly, the quickness with which machine work is learnt by young
people, does away with the necessity of bringing up for exclusive employment by
machinery, a special class of operatives.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn589" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref589"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">101</span></a>
With regard to the work of the mere attendants, it can, to some extent, be
replaced in the mill by machines,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn590" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref590"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">102</span></a>
and owing to its extreme simplicity, it allows of a rapid and constant change
of the individuals burdened with this drudgery. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a103"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although then, technically speaking, the old
system of division of labour is thrown overboard by machinery, it hangs on in
the factory, as a traditional habit handed down from Manufacture, and is
afterwards systematically re-moulded and established in a more hideous form by
capital, as a means of exploiting labour-power. The life-long speciality of
handling one and the same tool, now becomes the life-long speciality of serving
one and the same machine. Machinery is put to a wrong use, with the object of
transforming the workman, from his very childhood, into a part of a
detail-machine.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn591" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref591"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">103</span></a> In this
way, not only are the expenses of his reproduction considerably lessened, but
at the same time his helpless dependence upon the factory as a whole, and
therefore upon the capitalist, is rendered complete. Here as everywhere else,
we must distinguish between the increased productiveness due to the development
of the social process of production, and that due to the capitalist
exploitation of that process. In handicrafts and manufacture, the workman makes
use of a tool, in the factory, the machine makes use of him. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a105"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a104"></a>There the movements of the instrument of labour proceed from him,
here it is the movements of the machine that he must follow. In manufacture the
workmen are parts of a living mechanism. In the factory we have a lifeless
mechanism independent of the workman, who becomes its mere living appendage.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The miserable
routine of endless drudgery and toil in which the same mechanical process is
gone through over and over again, is like the labour of Sisyphus. The burden of
labour, like the rock, keeps ever falling back on the worn-out labourer.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn592" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref592"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">104</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At the same time that factory work exhausts the
nervous system to the uttermost, it does away with the many-sided play of the
muscles, and confiscates every atom of freedom, both in bodily and intellectual
activity.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn593" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref593"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">105</span></a> The lightening of the
labour, even, becomes a sort of torture, since the machine does not free the
labourer from work, but deprives the work of all interest. Every kind of
capitalist production, in so far as it is not only a labour-process, but also a
process of creating surplus-value, has this in common, that it is not the
workman that employs the instruments of labour, but the instruments of labour
that employ the workman. But it is only in the factory system that this
inversion for the first time acquires technical and palpable reality. By means
of its conversion into an automaton, the instrument of labour confronts the
labourer, during the labour-process, in the shape of capital, of dead labour,
that dominates, and pumps dry, living labour-power. The separation of the
intellectual powers of production from the manual labour, and the conversion of
those powers into the might of capital over labour, is, as we have already
shown, finally completed by modern industry erected on the foundation of
machinery. The special skill of each individual insignificant factory operative
vanishes as an infinitesimal quantity before the science, the gigantic physical
forces, and the mass of labour that are embodied in the factory mechanism and,
together with that mechanism, constitute the power of the “master.” <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a106"></a>This “master,” therefore, in whose brain the machinery and his
monopoly of it are inseparably united, whenever he falls out with his “hands,”
contemptuously tells them:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The factory
operatives should keep in wholesome remembrance the fact that theirs is really
a low species of skilled labour; and that there is none which is more easily
acquired, or of its quality more amply remunerated, or which by a short
training of the least expert can be more quickly, as well as abundantly,
acquired.... The master’s machinery really plays a far more important part in
the business of production than the labour and the skill of the operative,
which six months’ education can teach, and a common labourer can learn.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn594" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref594"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">106</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
technical subordination of the workman to the uniform motion of the instruments
of labour, and the peculiar composition of the body of workpeople, consisting
as it does of individuals of both sexes and of all ages, give rise to a barrack
discipline, which is elaborated into a complete system in the factory, and
which fully develops the before mentioned labour of overlooking, thereby
dividing the workpeople into operatives and overlookers, into private soldiers
and sergeants of an industrial army. “The main difficulty [in the automatic
factory] ... lay ... above all in training human beings to renounce their
desultory habits of work, and to identify themselves with the unvarying
regularity of the complex automaton. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a107"></a>To devise and administer
a successful code of factory discipline, suited to the necessities of factory
diligence, was the Herculean enterprise, the noble achievement of Arkwright!
Even at the present day, when the system is perfectly organised and its labour
lightened to the utmost, it is found nearly impossible to convert persons past
the age of puberty, into useful factory hands.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn595" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref595"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">107</span></a>
The factory code in which capital formulates, like a private legislator, and at
his own good will, his autocracy over his workpeople, unaccompanied by that
division of responsibility, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a108"></a>in other matters so much approved
of by the bourgeoisie, and unaccompanied by the still more approved
representative system, this code is but the capitalistic caricature of that
social regulation of the labour-process which becomes requisite in co-operation
on a great scale, and in the employment in common, of instruments of labour and
especially of machinery. The place of the slave-driver’s lash is taken by the
overlooker’s book of penalties. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a110"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a109"></a>All
punishments naturally resolve themselves into fines and deductions from wages,
and the law-giving talent of the factory Lycurgus so arranges matters, that a
violation of his laws is, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a111"></a>if possible, more profitable to him
than the keeping of them.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn596" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref596"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">108</span></a> We
shall here merely allude to the material conditions under which factory labour
is carried on. Every organ of sense is injured in an equal degree by artificial
elevation of the temperature, by the dust-laden atmosphere, by the deafening
noise, not to mention danger to life and limb among the thickly crowded
machinery, which, with the regularity of the seasons, issues its list of the
killed and wounded in the industrial battle.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn597" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref597"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">109</span></a>
Economy of the social means of production, matured and forced as in a hothouse
by the factory system, is turned, in the hands of capital, into systematic
robbery of what is necessary for the life of the workman while he is at work,
robbery of space, light, air, and of protection to his person against the
dangerous and unwholesome accompaniments of the productive process, not to
mention the robbery of appliances for the comfort of the workman.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn598" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref598"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">110</span></a> Is Fourier wrong when he calls factories

Strife Between Workman and Machine</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The contest between the capitalist and the
wage-labourer dates back to the very origin of capital. It raged on throughout
the whole manufacturing period. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn600" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref600"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">112</span></a> But
only since the introduction of machinery has the workman fought against the
instrument of labour itself, the material embodiment of capital. He revolts
against this particular form of the means of production, as being the material
basis of the capitalist mode of production. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the 17th century nearly all Europe
experienced revolts of the workpeople against the ribbon-loom, a machine for
weaving ribbons and trimmings, called in Germany Bandmühle, Schnurmühle, and
Mühlenstuhl. These machines were invented in Germany. Abbé Lancellotti, in a
work that appeared in Venice in 1636, but which was written in 1579, says as
follows:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Anthony
Müller of Danzig saw about 50 years ago in that town, a very ingenious machine,
which weaves 4 to 6 pieces at once. But the Mayor being apprehensive that this
invention might throw a large number of workmen on the streets, caused the
inventor to be secretly strangled or drowned.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In Leyden, this machine was not used till 1629;
there the riots of the ribbon-weavers at length compelled the Town Council to
prohibit it.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“In hac
urbe,” says Boxhorn (Inst. Pol., 1663), referring to the introduction of this
machine into Leyden, “</span><span lang="LA">ante
hos viginti circiter annos instrumentum quidam invenerunt textorium, quo solus
plus panni et facilius conficere poterat, quan plures aequali tempore. Hinc
turbae ortae et querulae textorum, tandemque usus hujus instrumenti a
magistratu prohibitus est</span><span lang="EN-GB">.”
<br class="calibre7"/>
[In this town, about twenty years ago certain people invented an instrument for
weaving, with which a single person could weave more cloth, and more easily,
than many others in the same length of time. As a result there arose
disturbances and complaints from the weavers, until the Town Council finally
prohibited the use of this instrument.]</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After making various decrees more or less
prohibitive against this loom in 1632, 1639, &amp;c., the States General of
Holland at length permitted it to be used, under certain conditions, by the
decree of the 15th December, 1661. It was also prohibited in Cologne in 1676,
at the same time that its introduction into England was causing disturbances
among the workpeople. By an imperial Edict of 19th Feb., 1685, its use was
forbidden throughout all Germany. In Hamburg it was burnt in public by order of
the Senate. The Emperor Charles VI., on 9th Feb., 1719, renewed the edict of
1685, and not till 1765 was its use openly allowed in the Electorate of Saxony.
This machine, which shook Europe to its foundations, was in fact the precursor
of the mule and the power-loom, and of the industrial revolution of the 18th
century. It enabled a totally inexperienced boy, to set the whole loom with all
its shuttles in motion, by simply moving a rod backwards and forwards, and in
its improved form produced from 40 to 50 pieces at once. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">About 1630, a wind-sawmill, erected near London
by a Dutchman, succumbed to the excesses of the populace. Even as late as the
beginning of the 18th century, sawmills driven by water overcame the opposition
of the people, supported as it was by Parliament, only with great difficulty.
No sooner had Everet in 1758 erected the first wool-shearing machine that was
driven by water-power, than it was set on fire by 100,000 people who had been
thrown out of work. Fifty thousand workpeople, who had previously lived by <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a113"></a>carding wool, petitioned Parliament against Arkwright’s
scribbling mills and carding engines. The enormous destruction of machinery
that occurred in the English manufacturing districts during the first 15 years
of this century, chiefly caused by the employment of the power-loom, and known
as the Luddite movement, gave the anti-Jacobin governments of a Sidmouth, a
Castlereagh, and the like, a pretext for the most reactionary and forcible
measures. It took both time and experience before the workpeople learnt to
distinguish between machinery and its employment by capital, and to direct
their attacks, not against the material instruments of production, but against
the mode in which they are used.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn601" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref601"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">113</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The contests about wages in Manufacture,
pre-suppose manufacture, and are in no sense directed against its existence.
The opposition against the establishment of new manufactures, proceeds from the
guilds and privileged towns, not from the workpeople. Hence the writers of the
manufacturing period treat the division of labour chiefly as a means of
virtually supplying a deficiency of labourers, and not as a means of actually
displacing those in work. This distinction is self-evident. If it be said that
100 millions of people would be required in England to spin with the old
spinning-wheel the cotton that is now spun with mules by 500,000 people, this
does not mean that the mules took the place of those millions who never
existed. It means only this, that many millions of workpeople would be required
to replace the spinning machinery. If, on the other hand, we say, that in
England the power-loom threw 800,000 weavers on the streets, we do not refer to
existing machinery, that would have to be replaced by a definite number of
workpeople, but to a number of weavers in existence who were actually replaced
or displaced by the looms. During the manufacturing period, handicraft labour,
altered though it was by division of labour, was yet the basis. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a114"></a>The
demands of the new colonial markets could not be satisfied owing to the relatively
small number of town operatives handed down from the middle ages, and the
manufactures proper opened out new fields of production to the rural
population, driven from the land by the dissolution of the feudal system. At
that time, therefore, division of labour and co-operation in the workshops,
were viewed more from the positive aspect, that they made the workpeople more
productive.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn602" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref602"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">114</span></a> Long before the period of
modern industry, co-operation and the concentration of the instruments of
labour in the hands of a few, gave rise, in numerous countries where these
methods were applied in agriculture, to great, sudden and forcible revolutions <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a115"></a>in the modes of production, and consequentially, in the
conditions of existence, and the means of employment of the rural populations.
But this contest at first takes place more between the large and the small
landed proprietors, than between capital and wage labour; on the other hand,
when the labourers are displaced by the instruments of labour, by sheep,
horses, &amp;c., in this case force is directly resorted to in the first
instance as the prelude to the industrial revolution. The labourers are first
driven from the land, and then come the sheep. Land grabbing on a great scale,
such as was perpetrated in England, is the first step in creating a field for
the establishment of agriculture on a great scale.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn603" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref603"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">115</span></a> Hence this subversion of agriculture
puts on, at first, more the appearance of a political revolution. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a116"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The instrument of labour, when it takes the form
of a machine, immediately becomes a competitor of the workman himself.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn604" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref604"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">116</span></a> The self-expansion of capital by means
of machinery is thenceforward directly proportional to the number of the
workpeople, whose means of livelihood have been destroyed by that machinery.
The whole system of capitalist production is based on the fact that the workman
sells his labour-power as a commodity. Division of labour specialises this
labour-power, by reducing it to skill in handling a particular tool. So soon as
the handling of this tool becomes the work of a machine, then, with the
use-value, the exchange-value too, of the workman’s labour-power vanishes; the
workman becomes unsaleable, like paper money thrown out of currency by legal
enactment. That portion of the working-class, thus by machinery rendered
superfluous, i.e., no longer immediately necessary for the self-expansion of
capital, either goes to the wall in the unequal contest of the old handicrafts
and manufactures with machinery, or else floods all the more easily accessible branches
of industry, swamps the labour-market, and sinks the price of labour-power
below its value. It is impressed upon the workpeople, as a great consolation,
first, that their sufferings are only temporary (“a temporary
inconvenience"), secondly, that machinery acquires the mastery over the
whole of a given field of production, only by degrees, so that the extent and
intensity of its destructive effect is diminished. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a118"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a117"></a>The first consolation neutralises the second. When machinery
seizes on an industry by degrees, it produces chronic misery among the
operatives who compete with it. Where the transition is rapid, the effect is
acute and felt by great masses. History discloses no tragedy more horrible than
the gradual extinction of the English hand-loom weavers, an extinction that was
spread over several decades, and finally sealed in 1838. Many of them died of
starvation, many with families vegetated for a long time on 2½ d. a day.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn605" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref605"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">117</span></a> On the other hand, the English cotton
machinery produced an acute effect in India. The Governor General reported
1834-35:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The misery
hardly finds a parallel in the history of commerce. The bones of the
cotton-weavers are bleaching the plains of India.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">No doubt, in turning them out of this “temporal”
world, the machinery caused them no more than “a temporary inconvenience.” For
the rest, since machinery is continually seizing upon new fields of production,
its temporary effect is really permanent. Hence, the character of independence
and estrangement which the capitalist mode of production as a whole gives to
the instruments of labour and to the product, as against the workman, is
developed by means of machinery into a thorough antagonism.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn606" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref606"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">118</span></a> Therefore, it is with the advent of
machinery, that the workman for the first time brutally revolts against the
instruments of labour. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a121"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a120"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a119"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The instrument of labour strikes down the
labourer. This direct antagonism between the two comes out most strongly,
whenever newly introduced machinery competes with handicrafts or manufactures,
handed down from former times. But even in modern industry the continual
improvement of machinery, and the development of the automatic system, has an
analogous effect.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The object
of improved machinery is to diminish manual labour, to provide for the
performance of a process or the completion of a link in a manufacture by the
aid of an iron instead of the human apparatus.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn607" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref607"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">119</span></a>“The
adaptation of power to machinery heretofore moved by hand, is almost of daily
occurrence ... the minor improvements in machinery having for their object
economy of power, the production of better work, the turning off more work in

constant, and although sometimes apparently of no great moment, have somewhat

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The extraordinary power of expansion of the
factory system owing to accumulated practical experience, to the mechanical
means at hand, and to constant technical progress, was proved to us by the
giant strides of that system under the pressure of a shortened working day. But
who, in 1860, the Zenith year of the English cotton industry, would have dreamt
of the galloping improvements in machinery, and the corresponding displacement
of working people, called into being during the following 3 years, under the
stimulus of the American Civil War? A couple of examples from the Reports of
the Inspectors of Factories will suffice on this point. A Manchester
manufacturer states:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“We formerly
had 75 carding engines, now we have 12, doing the same quantity of work.... We
are doing with fewer hands by 14, at a saving in wages of £10 a-week. Our
estimated saving in waste is about 10% in the quantity of cotton consumed.” “In
another fine-spinning mill in Manchester, I was informed that through increased
speed and the adoption of some self-acting processes, a reduction had been
made, in number, of a fourth in one department, and of above half in another,
and that the introduction of the combing machine in place of the second
carding, had considerably reduced, the number of hands formerly employed in the
carding-room.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Another spinning-mill is estimated to effect a
saving of labour of 10%. The Messrs. Gilmour, spinners at Manchester, state:
“In our blowing-room department we consider our expense with new machinery is
fully one-third less in wages and hands ... in the jack-frame and drawing-frame
room, about one-third less in expense, and likewise one-third less in hands; in
the spinning room about one-third less in expenses. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a126"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a125"></a>But this is not all; when our yarn goes to the manufacturers, it
is so much better by the application of our new machinery, that they will
produce a greater quantity of cloth, and cheaper than from the yarn produced by
old machinery.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn613" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref613"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">125</span></a> Mr.
Redgrave further remarks in the same Report:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The
reduction of hands against increased production is, in fact, constantly taking
place, in woollen mills the reduction commenced some time since, and is
continuing; a few days since, the master of a school in the neighbourhood of
Rochdale said to me, that the great falling off in the girls’ school is not
only caused by the distress, but by the changes of machinery in the woollen
mills, in consequence of which a reduction of 70 short-timers had taken place.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hence, between 1861 and 1868, 338 cotton
factories disappeared, in other words more productive machinery on a larger
scale was concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of capitalists. The
number of power-looms decreased by 20,663; but since their product increased in
the same period, an improved loom must have yielded more than an old one.
Lastly the number of spindles increased by 1,612,541, while the number of
operatives decreased by 50,505. The “temporary” misery inflicted on the
workpeople by the cotton-crisis, was heightened, and from being temporary made
permanent, by the rapid and persistent progress of machinery. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a129"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a128"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a127"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But machinery not only acts as a competitor who
gets the better of the workman, and is constantly on the point of making him
superfluous. It is also a power inimical to him, and as such capital proclaims
it from the roof tops and as such makes use of it. It is the most powerful
weapon for repressing strikes, those periodical revolts of the working-class
against the autocracy of capital.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn615" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref615"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">127</span></a>
According to Gaskell, the steam-engine was from the very first an antagonist of
human power, an antagonist that enabled the capitalist to tread under foot the
growing claims of the workmen, who threatened the newly born factory system
with a crisis.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn616" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref616"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">128</span></a> It would be possible to
write quite a history of the inventions, made since 1830, for the sole purpose
of supplying capital with weapons against the revolts of the working-class. At
the head of these in importance, stands the self-acting mule, because it opened
up a new epoch in the automatic system.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn617" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref617"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">129</span></a>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Nasmyth, the inventor of the steam-hammer, gives
the following evidence before the Trades’ Union Commission, with regard to the
improvements made by him in machinery and introduced in consequence of the
wide-spread and long strikes of the engineers in 1851.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The
characteristic feature of our modern mechanical improvements, is the
introduction of self-acting tool machinery. What every mechanical workman has
now to do, and what every boy can do, is not to work himself but to superintend
the beautiful labour of the machine. The whole class of workmen that depend
exclusively on their skill, is now done away with. Formerly, I employed four
boys to every mechanic. Thanks to these new mechanical combinations, I have
reduced the number of grown-up men from 1,500 to 750. The result was a considerable
increase in my profits.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Ure says of a machine used in calico printing:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“At length
capitalists sought deliverance from this intolerable bondage” [namely the, in
their eyes, burdensome terms of their contracts with the workmen] “in the
resources of science, and were speedily re-instated in their legitimate rule,
that of the head over the inferior members.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Speaking of an invention for dressing warps:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Then the
combined malcontents, who fancied themselves impregnably entrenched behind the
old lines of division of labour, found their flanks turned and their defences
rendered useless by the new mechanical tactics, and were obliged to surrender
at discretion.” <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a130"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">With regard to the invention of the self-acting
mule, he says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“A creation
destined to restore order among the industrious classes.... This invention
confirms the great doctrine already propounded, that when capital enlists
science into her service, the refractory hand of labour will always be taught
docility.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn618" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref618"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">130</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although Ure’s work appeared 30 years ago, at a
time when the factory system was comparatively but little developed, it still
perfectly expresses the spirit of the factory, not only by its undisguised
cynicism, but also by the naïveté with which it blurts out the stupid
contradictions of the capitalist brain. For instance, after propounding the
“doctrine” stated above, that capital, with the aid of science taken into its
pay, always reduces the refractory hand of labour to docility, he grows
indignant because</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“it
(physico-mechanical science) has been accused of lending itself to the rich
capitalist as an instrument for harassing the poor.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After preaching a long sermon to show how
advantageous the rapid development of machinery is to the working-classes, he
warns them, that by their obstinacy and their strikes they hasten that
development.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Violent
revulsions of this nature,” he says, “display short-sighted man in the
contemptible character of a self-tormentor.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A few pages before he states the contrary.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Had it not
been for the violent collisions and interruptions resulting from erroneous
views among the factory operatives, the factory system would have been
developed still more rapidly and beneficially for all concerned.” Then he
exclaims again: “Fortunately for the state of society in the cotton districts
of Great Britain, the improvements in machinery are gradual.” “It” (improvement
in machinery) “is said to lower the rate of earnings of adults by displacing a
portion of them, and thus rendering their number superabundant as compared with
the demand for their labour. It certainly augments the demand for the labour of
children and increases the rate of <i class="calibre4">their </i>wages.” <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a131"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the other hand, this same dispenser of
consolation defends the lowness of the children’s wages on the ground that it
prevents parents from sending their children at too early an age into the
factory. The whole of his book is a vindication of a working day of
unrestricted length; that Parliament should forbid children of 13 years to be
exhausted by working 12 hours a day, reminds his liberal soul of the darkest
days of the Middle Ages. This does not prevent him from calling upon the
factory operatives to thank Providence, who by means of machinery has given
them the leisure to think of their “immortal interests.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn619" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref619"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">131</span></a> </span></p>
