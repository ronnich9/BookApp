Theory of Compensation as Regards the Workpeople Displaced by Machinery</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">James Mill, MacCulloch, Torrens, Senior, John
Stuart Mill, and a whole series besides, of bourgeois political economists,
insist that all machinery that displaces workmen, simultaneously and
necessarily sets free an amount of capital adequate to employ the same
identical workmen. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a133"></a><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn620" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref620"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">132</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Suppose a capitalist to employ 100 workmen, at
£30 a year each, in a carpet factory. The variable capital annually laid out
amounts, therefore, to £3,000. Suppose, also, that he discharges 50 of his
workmen, and employs the remaining 50 with machinery that costs him £1,500. To
simplify matters, we take no account of buildings, coal, &amp;c. Further
suppose that the raw material annually consumed costs £3,000, both before and
after the change.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn621" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref621"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">133</span></a> Is any
capital set free by this metamorphosis? Before the change, the total sum of
£6,000 consisted half of constant, and half of variable capital. After the
change it consists of £4,500 constant ( £3,000 raw material and £1,500
machinery), and £1,500 variable capital. The variable capital, instead of being
one half, is only one quarter, of the total capital. Instead of being set free,
a part of the capital is here locked up in such a way as to cease to be
exchanged against labour-power: variable has been changed into constant
capital. Other things remaining unchanged, the capital of £6,000, can, in
future, employ no more than 50 men. With each improvement in the machinery, it
will employ fewer. If the newly introduced machinery had cost less than did the
labour-power and implements displaced by it, if, for instance, instead of
costing £1,500, it had cost only £1,000, a variable capital of £1,000 would
have been converted into constant capital, and locked up; and a capital of £500
would have been set free. The latter sum, supposing wages unchanged, would form
a fund sufficient to employ about 16 out of the 50 men discharged; nay, less
than 16, for, in order to be employed as capital, a part of this £500 must now
become constant capital, thus leaving only the remainder to be laid out in
labour-power. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But, suppose, besides, that the making of the
new machinery affords employment to a greater number of mechanics, can that be
called compensation to the carpet-makers, thrown on the streets? At the best,
its construction employs fewer men than its employment displaces. The sum of
£1,500 that formerly represented the wages of the discharged carpet-makers, now
represents in the shape of machinery: (1) the value of the means of production
used in the construction of that machinery, (2) the wages of the mechanics
employed in its construction, and (3) the surplus-value falling to the share of
their “master.” Further, the machinery need not be renewed till it is worn out.
Hence, in order to keep the increased number of mechanics in constant
employment, one carpet manufacturer after another must displace workmen by
machines. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As a matter of fact the apologists do not mean
this sort of setting free. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">They have in their minds the means of subsistence
of the liberated work-people. It cannot be denied, in the above instance, that
the machinery not only liberates 50 men, thus placing them at others’ disposal,
but, at the same time, it withdraws from their consumption, and sets free,
means of subsistence to the value of £1,500. The simple fact, by no means a new
one, that machinery cuts off the workmen from their means of subsistence is,
therefore, in economic parlance tantamount to this, that machinery liberates
means of subsistence for the workman, or converts those means into capital for
his employment. The mode of expression, you see, is everything. Nominibus
mollire licet mala. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This theory implies that the £1,500 worth of
means of subsistence was capital that was being expanded by the labour of the
50 men discharged. That, consequently, this capital falls out of employment so
soon as they commence their forced holidays, and never rests till it has found
a fresh investment, where it can again be productively consumed by these same
50 men. That sooner or later, therefore, the capital and the workmen must come
together again, and that, then, the compensation is complete. That the
sufferings of the workmen displaced by machinery are therefore as transient as
are the riches of this world. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In relation to the discharged workmen, the
£1,500 worth of means of subsistence never was capital. What really confronted
them as capital, was the sum of £1,500, afterwards laid out in machinery. On
looking closer it will be seen that this sum represented part of the carpets
produced in a year by the 50 discharged men, which part they received as wages
from their employer in money instead of in kind. With the carpets in the form
of money, they bought means of subsistence to the value of £1,500. These means,
therefore, were to them, not capital, but commodities, and they, as regards
these commodities, were not wage-labourers, but buyers. The circumstance that
they were “freed” by the machinery, from the means of purchase, changed them
from buyers into non-buyers. Hence a lessened demand for those commodities –
voilà tout. If this diminution be not compensated by an increase from some
other quarter, the market price of the commodities falls. If this state of
things lasts for some time, and extends, there follows a discharge of workmen
employed in the production of these commodities. Some of the capital that was
previously devoted to production of necessary means of subsistence, has to
become reproduced in another form. While prices fall, and capital is being
displaced, the labourers employed in the production of necessary means of
subsistence are in their turn “freed” from a part of their wages. Instead,
therefore, of proving that, when machinery frees the workman from his means of
subsistence, it simultaneously converts those means into capital for his
further employment, our apologists, with their cut-and-dried law of supply and
demand, prove, on the contrary, that machinery throws workmen on the streets,
not only in that branch of production in which it is introduced, but also in
those branches in which it is not introduced. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The real facts, which are travestied by the
optimism of economists, are as follows: The labourers, when driven out of the
workshop by the machinery, are thrown upon the labour market, and there add to
the number of workmen at the disposal of the capitalists. In Part VII of this
book it will be seen that this effect of machinery, which, as we have seen, is
represented to be a compensation to the working class, is on the contrary a
most frightful scourge. For the present I will only say this: The labourers
that are thrown out of work in any branch of industry, can no doubt seek for
employment in some other branch. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a134"></a>If they find it, and thus
renew the bond between them and the means of subsistence, this takes place only
by the intermediary of a new and additional capital that is seeking investment;
not at all by the intermediary of the capital that formerly employed them and
was afterwards converted into machinery. And even should they find employment,
what a poor look-out is theirs! Crippled as they are by division of labour,
these poor devils are worth so little outside their old trade, that they cannot
find admission into any industries, except a few of inferior kind, that are
over-supplied with underpaid workmen.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn622" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref622"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">134</span></a>
Further, every branch of industry attracts each year a new stream of men, who
furnish a contingent from which to fill up vacancies, and to draw a supply for
expansion. So soon as machinery sets free a part of the workmen employed in a
given branch of industry, the reserve men are also diverted into new channels
of employment, and become absorbed in other branches; meanwhile the original
victims, during the period of transition, for the most part starve and perish. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is an undoubted fact that machinery, as such,
is not responsible for “setting free” the workman from the means of
subsistence. It cheapens and increases production in that branch which it
seizes on, and at first makes no change in the mass of the means of subsistence
produced in other branches. Hence, after its introduction, the society
possesses as much, if not more, of the necessaries of life than before, for the
labourers thrown out of work; and that quite apart from the enormous share of
the annual produce wasted by the non-workers. And this is the point relied on
by our apologists! The contradictions and antagonisms inseparable from the
capitalist employment of machinery, do not exist, they say, since they do not
arise out of machinery, as such, but out of its capitalist employment! Since
therefore machinery, considered alone, shortens the hours of labour, but, when
in the service of capital, lengthens them; since in itself it lightens labour,
but when employed by capital, heightens the intensity of labour; since in
itself it is a victory of man over the forces of Nature, but in the hands of
capital, makes man the slave of those forces; since in itself it increases the
wealth of the producers, but in the hands of capital, makes them paupers -
for all these reasons and others besides, says the bourgeois economist without
more ado, it is clear as noon-day that all these contradictions are a mere
semblance of the reality, and that, as a matter of fact, they have neither an
actual nor a theoretical existence. Thus he saves himself from all further
puzzling of the brain, and what is more, implicitly declares his opponent to be
stupid enough to contend against, not the capitalistic employment of machinery,
but machinery itself. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a136"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a135"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">No doubt he is far from denying that temporary
inconvenience may result from the capitalist use of machinery. But where is the
medal without its reverse! Any employment of machinery, except by capital, is
to him an impossibility. Exploitation of the workman by the machine is
therefore, with him, identical with exploitation of the machine by the workman.
Whoever, therefore, exposes the real state of things in the capitalistic
employment of machinery, is against its employment in any way, and is an enemy
of social progress!<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn623" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref623"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">135</span></a> Exactly
the reasoning of the celebrated Bill Sykes. “Gentlemen of the jury, no doubt
the throat of this commercial traveller has been cut. But that is not my fault,
it is the fault of the knife. Must we, for such a temporary inconvenience,
abolish the use of the knife? Only consider! where would agriculture and trade
be without the knife? Is it not as salutary in surgery, as it is knowing in
anatomy? And in addition a willing help at the festive board? If you abolish
the knife – you hurl us back into the depths of barbarism.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn624" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref624"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">136</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although machinery necessarily throws men out of
work in those industries into which it is introduced, yet it may,
notwithstanding this, bring about an increase of employment in other
industries. This effect, however, has nothing in common with the so-called
theory of compensation. Since every article produced by a machine is cheaper
than a similar article produced by hand, we deduce the following infallible
law: If the total quantity of the article produced by machinery, be equal to
the total quantity of the article previously produced by a handicraft or by
manufacture, and now made by machinery, then the total labour expended is
diminished. The new labour spent on the instruments of labour, on the
machinery, on the coal, and so on, must necessarily be less than the labour displaced
by the use of the machinery; otherwise the product of the machine would be as
dear, or dearer, than the product of the manual labour. But, as a matter of
fact, the total quantity of the article produced by machinery with a diminished
number of workmen, instead of remaining equal to, by far exceeds the total
quantity of the hand-made article that has been displaced. Suppose that 400,000
yards of cloth have been produced on power-looms by fewer weavers than could
weave 100,000 yards by hand. In the quadrupled product there lies four times as
much raw material. Hence the production of raw material must be quadrupled. But
as regards the instruments of labour, such as buildings, coal, machinery, and
so on, it is different; the limit up to which the additional labour required
for their production can increase, varies with the difference between the
quantity of the machine-made article, and the quantity of the same article that
the same number of workmen could make by hand. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hence, as the use of machinery extends in a
given industry, the immediate effect is to increase production in the other
industries that furnish the first with means of production. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a139"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a138"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a137"></a>How far employment is thereby found for an
increased number of men, depends, given the length of the working day and the
intensity of labour, on the composition of the capital employed, i.e., on the
ratio of its constant to its variable component. This ratio, in its turn,
varies considerably with the extent to which machinery has already seized on,
or is then seizing on, those trades. The number of the men condemned to work in
coal and metal mines increased enormously owing to the progress of the English
factory system; but during the last few decades this increase of number has
been less rapid, owing to the use of new machinery in mining.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn625" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref625"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">137</span></a> A new type of workman springs into life
along with the machine, namely, its maker. We have already learnt that machinery
has possessed itself even of this branch of production on a scale that grows
greater every day.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn626" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref626"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">138</span></a> As to
raw material,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn627" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref627"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">139</span></a> there is not the least
doubt that the rapid strides of cotton spinning, not only pushed on with
tropical luxuriance the growth of cotton in the United States, and with it the
African slave trade, but also made the breeding of slaves the chief business of
the border slave-states. When, in 1790, the first census of slaves was taken in
the United States, their number was 697,000; in 1861 it had nearly reached four
millions. On the other hand, it is no less certain that the rise of the English
woollen factories, together with the gradual conversion of arable land into
sheep pasture, brought, about the superfluity of agricultural labourers that
led to their being driven in masses into the towns. Ireland, having during the
last twenty years reduced its population by nearly one half, is at this moment
undergoing the process of still further reducing the number of its inhabitants,
so as exactly to suit the requirements of its landlords and of the English
woollen manufacturers. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a140"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When machinery is applied to any of the
preliminary or intermediate stages through which the subject of labour has to
pass on its way to completion, there is an increased yield of material in those
stages, and simultaneously an increased demand for labour in the handicrafts or
manufactures supplied by the produce of the machines. Spinning by machinery,
for example, supplied yarn so cheaply and so abundantly that the hand-loom
weavers were, at first, able to work full time without increased outlay. Their
earnings accordingly rose.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn628" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref628"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">140</span></a> Hence a
flow of people into the cotton-weaving trade, till at length the 800,000
weavers, called into existence by the Jenny, the throstle and the mule, were
overwhelmed by the power-loom. So also, owing to the abundance of clothing
materials produced by machinery, the number of tailors, seamstresses and
needlewomen, went on increasing until the appearance of the sewing-machine. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In proportion as machinery, with the aid of a
relatively small number of workpeople, increases the mass of raw materials, intermediate
products, instruments of labour, &amp;c., the working-up of these raw materials
and intermediate products becomes split up into numberless branches; social
production increases in diversity. The factory system carries the social
division of labour immeasurably further than does manufacture, for it increases
the productiveness of the industries it seizes upon, in a far higher degree. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a142"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a141"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The immediate result of machinery is to augment surplus-value
and the mass of products in which surplus-value is embodied. And, as the
substances consumed by the capitalists and their dependents become more
plentiful, so too do these orders of society. Their growing wealth, and the
relatively diminished number of workmen required to produce the necessaries of
life beget, simultaneously with the rise of new and luxurious wants, the means
of satisfying those wants. A larger portion of the produce of society is
changed into surplus-produce, and a larger part of the surplus-produce is
supplied for consumption in a multiplicity of refined shapes. In other words,
the production of luxuries increases.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn629" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref629"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">141</span></a>
The refined and varied forms of the products are also due to new relations with
the markets of the world, relations that are created by modern industry. Not
only are greater quantities of foreign articles of luxury exchanged for home
products, but a greater mass of foreign raw materials, ingredients, and
intermediate products, are used as means of production in the home industries.
Owing to these relations with the markets of the world, the demand for labour
increases in the carrying trades, which split up into numerous varieties.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn630" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref630"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">142</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The increase of the means of production and
subsistence, accompanied by a relative diminution in the number of labourers,
causes an increased demand for labour in making canals, docks, tunnels,
bridges, and so on, works that can only bear fruit in the far future. Entirely
new branches of production, creating new fields of labour, are also formed, as
the direct result either of machinery or of the general industrial changes
brought about by it. But the place occupied by these branches in the general
production is, even in the most developed countries, far from important. The
number of labourers that find employment in them is directly proportional to the
demand, created by those industries, for the crudest form of manual labour. The
chief industries of this kind are, at present, gas-works, telegraphs,
photography, steam navigation, and railways. According to the census of 1861
for England and Wales, we find in the gas industry (gas-works, production of
mechanical apparatus, servants of the gas companies, &amp;c), 15,211 persons;
in telegraphy, 2,399; in photography, 2,366; steam navigation, 3,570; and in
railways, 70,599, of whom the unskilled “navvies,” more or less permanently
employed, and the whole administrative and commercial staff, make up about
28,000. The total number of persons, therefore, employed in these five new

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Lastly, the extraordinary productiveness of
modern industry, accompanied as it is by both a more extensive and a more
intense exploitation of labour-power in all other spheres of production, allows
of the unproductive employment of a larger and larger part of the
working-class, and the consequent reproduction, on a constantly extending
scale, of the ancient domestic slaves under the name of a servant class,
including men-servants, women-servants, lackeys, &amp;c. According to the
census of 1861, the population of England and Wales was 20,066,244; of these, 9,776,259

too old or too young for work, all unproductive women, young persons and
children, the “ideological” classes, such as government officials, priests,
lawyers, soldiers, &amp;c.; further, all who have no occupation but to consume
the labour of others in the form of rent, interest, &amp;c.; and, lastly,

Repulsion and Attraction of Workpeople by the Factory System. Crises in the
Cotton Trade</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">All political economists of any standing admit
that the introduction of new machinery has a baneful effect on the workmen in
the old handicrafts and manufactures with which this machinery at first
competes. Almost all of them bemoan the slavery of the factory operative. And
what is the great trump-card that they play? That machinery, after the horrors
of the period of introduction and development have subsided, instead of
diminishing, in the long run increases the number of the slaves of labour! Yes,
Political Economy revels in the hideous theory, hideous to every
“philanthropist” who believes in the eternal Nature-ordained necessity for
capitalist production, that after a period of growth and transition, even its
crowning success, the factory system based on machinery, grinds down more
workpeople than on its first introduction it throws on the streets.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn634" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref634"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">146</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is true that in some cases, as we saw from
instances of English worsted and silk factories, an extraordinary extension of
the factory system may, at a certain stage of its development, be accompanied
not only by a relative, but by an absolute decrease in the number of operatives
employed. In the year 1860, when a special census of all the factories in the
United Kingdom was taken by order of Parliament, the factories in those parts
of Lancashire, Cheshire, and Yorkshire, included in the district of Mr. Baker,
the factory inspector, numbered 652; 570 of these contained 85,622 power-looms,
6,819,146 spindles (exclusive of doubling spindles), employed 27,439 horse-power
(steam), <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a148"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a147"></a>and 1,390 (water), and 94,119
persons. In the year 1865, the same factories contained, looms 95,163, spindles
7,025,031, had a steam-power of 28,925 horses, and a water-power of 1,445
horses, and employed 88,913 persons. Between 1860 and 1865, therefore, the
increase in looms was 11%, in spindles 3%, and in engine-power 3%, while the
number of persons employed decreased 5½%.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn635" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref635"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">147</span></a>
Between 1852 and 1862, considerable extension of the English woollen
manufacture took place, while the number of hands employed in it remained
almost stationary, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a149"></a></span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“showing how
greatly the introduction of new machines had superseded the labour of preceding
periods.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn636" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref636"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">148</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In certain cases, the increase in the number of
hands employed is only apparent; that is, it is not due to the extension of the
factories already established, but to the gradual annexation of connected
trades; for instance, the increase in power-looms, and in the hands employed by
them between 1838 and 1856, was, in the cotton trade, simply owing to the
extension of this branch of industry; but in the other trades to the
application of steam-power to the carpet-loom, to the ribbon-loom, and to the
linen-loom, which previously had been worked by the power of men.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn637" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref637"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">149</span></a> Hence the increase of the hands in these
latter trades was merely a symptom of a diminution in the total number
employed. Finally, we have considered this question entirely apart from the
fact, that everywhere, except in the metal industries, young persons (under
18), and women and children form the preponderating element in the class of
factory hands. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Nevertheless, in spite of the mass of hands
actually displaced and virtually replaced by machinery, we can understand how
the factory operatives, through the building of more mills and the extension of
old ones in a given industry, may become more numerous than the manufacturing
workmen and handicraftsman that have been displaced. Suppose, for example, that
in the old mode of production, a capital of £500 is employed weekly, two-fifths
being constant and three-fifths variable capital, <i class="calibre4">i.e.</i>, £200 being laid
out in means of production, and £300, say £1 per man, in labour-power. On the
introduction of machinery the composition of this capital becomes altered. We
will suppose it to consist of four-fifths constant and one-fifth variable,
which means that only £100 is now laid out in labour-power. Consequently,
two-thirds of the workmen are discharged. If now the business extends, and the
total capital employed grows to £1,500 under unchanged conditions, the number
of operatives employed will increase to 300, just as many as before the
introduction of the machinery. If the capital further grows to £2,000, 400 men
will be employed, or one-third more than under the old system. Their numbers
have, in point of fact, increased by 100, but relatively, i.e., in proportion
to the total capital advanced, they have diminished by 800, for the £2,000
capital would, in the old state of things, have employed 1,200 instead of 400
men. Hence, a relative decrease in the number of hands is consistent with an
actual increase. We assumed above that while the total capital increases, its
composition remains the same, because the conditions of production remain
constant. But we have already seen that, with every advance in the use of
machinery, the constant component of capital, that part which consists of
machinery, raw material, &amp;c., increases, while the variable component, the
part laid out in labour-power, decreases. We also know that in no other system
of production is improvement so continuous, and the composition of the capital
employed so constantly changing as in the factory system. These changes are,
however, continually interrupted by periods of rest, during which there is a
mere quantitative extension of the factories on the existing technical basis. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a150"></a>During such periods the operatives increase in number. Thus, in
1835, the total number of operatives in the cotton, woollen, worsted, flax, and
silk factories of the United Kingdom was only 354,684; while in 1861 the number
of the power-loom weavers alone (of both sexes and of all ages, from eight
years upwards), amounted to 230,654. Certainly, this growth appears less
important when we consider that in 1838 the hand-loom weavers with their
families still numbered 800,000,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn638" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref638"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">15</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters">0</span> not to mention those thrown out of work in
Asia, and on the Continent of Europe. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the few remarks I have still to make on this
point, I shall refer to some actually existing relations, the existence of
which our theoretical investigation has not yet disclosed. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So long as, in a given branch of industry, the
factory system extends itself at the expense of the old handicrafts or of
manufacture, the result is as sure as is the result of an encounter between an
army furnished with breach-loaders, and one armed with bows and arrows. This
first period, during which machinery conquers its field of action, is of
decisive importance owing to the extraordinary profits that it helps to
produce. These profits not only form a source of accelerated accumulation, but also
attract into the favoured sphere of production a large part of the additional
social capital that is being constantly created, and is ever on the look-out
for new investments. The special advantages of this first period of fast and
furious activity are felt in every branch of production that machinery invades.
So soon, however, as the factory system has gained a certain breadth of footing
and a definite degree of maturity, and, especially, so soon as its technical
basis, machinery, is itself produced by machinery; so soon as coal mining and
iron mining, the metal industries, and the means of transport have been
revolutionised; so soon, in short, as the general conditions requisite for
production by the modern industrial system have been established, this mode of
production acquires an elasticity, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a152"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a151"></a>a capacity
for sudden extension by leaps and bounds that finds no hindrance except in the
supply of raw material and in the disposal of the produce. On the one hand, the
immediate effect of machinery is to increase the supply of raw material in the
same way, for example, as the cotton gin augmented the production of cotton.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn639" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref639"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">151</span></a> On the other hand, the cheapness of the
articles produced by machinery, and the improved means of transport and
communication furnish the weapons for conquering foreign markets. By ruining
handicraft production in other countries, machinery forcibly converts them into
fields for the supply of its raw material. In this way East India was compelled
to produce cotton, wool, hemp, jute, and indigo for Great Britain.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn640" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref640"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">152</span></a> By constantly making a part of the <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a154"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a153"></a>hands “supernumerary,” modern industry, in all
countries where it has taken root, gives a spur to emigration and to the
colonisation of foreign lands, which are thereby converted into settlements for
growing the raw material of the mother country; just as Australia, for example,
was converted into a colony for growing wool.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn641" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref641"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">153</span></a>
A new and international division of labour, a division suited to the
requirements of the chief centres of modern industry springs up, and converts
one part of the globe into a chiefly agricultural field of production, for
supplying the other part which remains a chiefly industrial field. This
revolution hangs together with radical changes in agriculture which we need not
here further inquire into.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn642" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref642"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">154</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The enormous power, inherent in the factory
system, of expanding by jumps, and the dependence of that system on the markets
of the world, necessarily beget feverish production, followed by over-filling
of the markets, whereupon contraction of the markets brings on crippling of
production. The life of modern industry becomes a series of periods of moderate
activity, prosperity, over-production, crisis and stagnation. The uncertainty
and instability to which machinery subjects the employment, and consequently
the conditions of existence, of the operatives become normal, owing to these
periodic changes of the industrial cycle. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a156"></a>Except in the
periods of prosperity, there rages between the capitalists the most furious
combat for the share of each in the markets. This share is directly proportional
to the cheapness of the product. Besides the rivalry that this struggle begets
in the application of improved machinery for replacing labour-power, and of new
methods of production, there also comes a time in every industrial cycle, when
a forcible reduction of wages beneath the value of labour-power, is attempted
for the purpose of cheapening commodities.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn643" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref643"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">155</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A necessary condition, therefore, to the growth
of the number of factory hands, is a proportionally much more rapid growth of
the amount of capital invested in mills. This growth, however, is conditioned
by the ebb and flow of the industrial cycle. It is, besides, constantly
interrupted by the technical progress that at one time virtually supplies the
place of new workmen, at another, actually displaces old ones. This qualitative
change in mechanical industry continually discharges hands from the factory, or
shuts its doors against the fresh stream of recruits, while the purely
quantitative extension of the factories absorbs not only the men thrown out of
work, but also fresh contingents. The workpeople are thus continually both
repelled and attracted, hustled from pillar to post, while, at the same time,
constant changes take place in the sex, age, and skill of the levies. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The lot of the factory operatives will be best
depicted by taking a rapid survey of the course of the English cotton industry.
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From 1770 to 1815 this trade was depressed or
stagnant for 5 years only. During this period of 45 years the English
manufacturers had a monopoly of machinery and of the markets of the world. From
1815 to 1821 depression; 1822 and 1823 prosperity; 1824 abolition of the laws
against Trades’ Unions, great extension of factories everywhere; 1825 crisis;
1826 great misery and riots among the factory operatives; 1827 slight
improvement; 1828 great increase in power-looms, and in exports; 1829 exports,
especially to India, surpass all former years; 1830 glutted markets, great distress;
1831 to 1833 continued depression, the monopoly of the trade with India and
China withdrawn from the East India Company; 1834 great increase of factories
and machinery, shortness of hands. The new poor law furthers the migration of
agricultural labourers into the factory districts. The country districts swept
of children. White slave trade; 1835 great prosperity, contemporaneous
starvation of the hand-loom weavers; 1836 great prosperity; 1837 and 1838
depression and crisis; 1839 revival; 1840 great depression, riots, calling out
of the military; 1841 and 1842 frightful suffering among the factory
operatives; 1842 the manufacturers lock the hands out of the factories in order
to enforce the repeal of the Corn Laws. The operatives stream in thousands into
the towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire, are driven back by the military, and
their leaders brought to trial at Lancaster; 1843 great misery; 1844 revival;
1845 great prosperity; 1846 continued improvement at first, then reaction.
Repeal of the Corn Laws; 1847 crisis, general reduction of wages by 10 and more

Manchester under military protection; 1849 revival; 1850 prosperity; 1851
falling prices, low wages, frequent strikes; 1852 improvement begins, strikes
continue, the manufacturers threaten to import foreign hands; 1853 increasing
exports. Strike for 8 months, and great misery at Preston; 1854 prosperity,

Canada, and the Eastern markets; 1856 great prosperity; 1857 crisis; 1858
improvement; 1859 great prosperity, increase in factories; 1860 Zenith of the
English cotton trade, the Indian, Australian, and other markets so glutted with
goods that even in 1863 they had not absorbed the whole lot; the French Treaty
of Commerce, enormous growth of factories and machinery; 1861 prosperity
continues for a time, reaction, the American Civil War, cotton famine: 1862 to
1863 complete collapse. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a158"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a157"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The history of the cotton famine is too
characteristic to dispense with dwelling upon it for a moment. From the
indications as to the condition of the markets of the world in 1860 and 1861,
we see that the cotton famine came in the nick of time for the manufacturers,
and was to some extent advantageous to them, a fact that was acknowledged in
the reports of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, proclaimed in Parliament by
Palmerston and Derby, and confirmed by events.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn644" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref644"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">156</span></a>
No doubt, among the 2,887 cotton mills in the United Kingdom in 1861, there
were many of small size. According to the report of Mr. A. Redgrave, out of the
2,109 mills included in his district, 392, or 19% employed less than ten
horse-power each; 345, or 16% employed 10 H. P., and less than 20 H. P.; while
1,372 employed upwards of 20 H. P.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn645" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref645"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">157</span></a>
The majority of the small mills were weaving sheds, built during the period of
prosperity after 1858, for the most part by speculators, of whom one supplied
the yarn, another the machinery, a third the buildings, and were worked by men
who had been overlookers, or by other persons of small means. These small
manufacturers mostly went to the wall. The same fate would have overtaken them
in the commercial crisis that was staved off only by the cotton famine.
Although they formed one-third of the total number of manufacturers, yet their
mills absorbed a much smaller part of the capital invested in the cotton trade.
As to the extent of the stoppage, it appears from authentic estimates, that in
October 1862, 60.3% of the spindles, and 58% of the looms were standing. This
refers to the cotton trade as a whole, and, of course, requires considerable
modification for individual districts. Only very few mills worked full time (60
hours a week), the remainder worked at intervals. Even in those few cases where
full time was worked, and at the customary rate of piece-wage, the weekly wages
of the operatives necessarily shrank, owing to good cotton being replaced by
bad, Sea Island by Egyptian (in fine spinning mills), American and Egyptian by
Surat, and pure cotton by mixings of waste and Surat. The shorter fibre of the
Surat cotton and its dirty condition, the greater fragility of the thread, the
substitution of all sorts of heavy ingredients for flour in sizing the warps,
all these lessened the speed of the machinery, or the number of the looms that
could be superintended by one weaver, increased the labour caused by defects in
the machinery, and reduced the piece-wage by reducing the mass of the product
turned off. Where Surat cotton was used, the loss to the operatives when on
full time, amounted to 20, 30, and more per cent. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a159"></a>But besides
this, the majority of the manufacturers reduced the rate of piece-wage by 5,
7½, and 10 per cent. We can therefore conceive the situation of those hands who
were employed for only 3, 3½ or 4 days a week, or for only 6 hours a day. Even
in 1863, after a comparative improvement had set in, the weekly wages of
spinners and of weavers were 3s. 4d., 3s. 10d., 4s. 6d. and 5s. 1d.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn646" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref646"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">158</span></a> Even in this miserable state of things,
however, the inventive spirit of the master never stood still, but was
exercised in making deductions from wages. These were to some extent inflicted
as a penalty for defects in the finished article that were really due to his
bad cotton and to his unsuitable machinery. Moreover, where the manufacturer
owned the cottages of the workpeople, he paid himself his rents by <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a161"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a160"></a>deducting the amount from these miserable wages.
Mr. Redgrave tells us of self-acting minders (operatives who manage a pair of
self-acting mules)</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“earning at
the end of a fortnight’s full work 8s. 11d., and that from this sum was
deducted the rent of the house, the manufacturer, however, returning half the
rent as a gift. The minders took away the sum of 6s. 11d. In many places the
self-acting minders ranged from 5s. to 9s. per week, and the weavers from 2s.
to 6s. per week, during the latter part of 1862.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn647" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref647"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">159</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Even when working short time the rent was
frequently deducted from the wages of the operatives.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn648" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref648"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">160</span></a> No wonder that in some parts of
Lancashire a kind of famine fever broke out. But more characteristic than all
this, was, the revolution that took place in the process of production at the
expense of the workpeople. Experimenta in corpore vili, like those of
anatomists on frogs, were formally made. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a162"></a></span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Although,”
says Mr. Redgrave, “I have given the actual earnings of the operatives in the
several mills, it does not follow that they earn the same amount week by week.
The operatives are subject to great fluctuation from the constant
experimentalising of the manufacturers ... the earnings of the operatives rise
and fall with the quality of the cotton mixings; sometimes they have been
within 15 per cent. of former earnings, and then, in a week or two, they have
fallen off from 50 to 60 per cent.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn649" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref649"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">161</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">These experiments were not made solely at the
expense of the workman’s means of subsistence. His five senses also had to pay
the penalty.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The people
who are employed in making up Surat cotton complain very much. They inform me,
on opening the bales of cotton there is an intolerable smell, which causes
sickness.... In the mixing, scribbling and carding rooms, the dust and dirt
which are disengaged, irritate the air passages, and give rise to cough and
difficulty of breathing. A disease of the skin, no doubt from the irritation of
the dirt contained in the Surat cotton, also prevails.... The fibre being so
short, a great amount of size, both animal and vegetable, is used....
Bronchitis is more prevalent owing to the dust. Inflammatory sore throat is
common, from the same cause. Sickness and dyspepsia are produced by the
frequent breaking of the weft, when the weaver sucks the weft through the eye
of the shuttle.” <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a164"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a163"></a>On the other hand, the
substitutes for flour were a Fortunatus’ purse to the manufacturers, by
increasing the weight of the yarn. They caused “15 lbs. of raw material to
weigh 26 lbs. after it was woven.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn650" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref650"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">162</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
Report of Inspectors of Factories for 30th April, 1864, we read as follows:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The trade is
availing itself of this resource at present to an extent which is even
discreditable. I have heard on good authority of a cloth weighing 8 lbs. which
was made of 5 1/4 lbs. cotton and 2 3/4 lbs. size; and of another cloth
weighing 5 1/4 lbs., of which 2 lbs. was size. These were ordinary export
shirtings. In cloths of other descriptions, as much as 50 per cent. size is
sometimes added; so that a manufacturer may, and does truly boast, that he is
getting rich by selling cloth for less money per pound than he paid for the
mere yarn of which they are composed.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn651" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref651"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">16</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But the workpeople had to suffer, not only from
the experiments of the manufacturers inside the mills, and of the
municipalities outside, not only from reduced wages and absence <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a165"></a>of
work, from want and from charity, and from the eulogistic speeches of lords and
commons.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Unfortunate
females who, in consequence of the cotton famine, were at its commencement
thrown out of employment, and have thereby become outcasts of society; and now,
though trade has revived, and work is plentiful, continue members of that
unfortunate class, and are likely to continue so. There are also in the borough
more youthful prostitutes than I have known for the last 25 years.” <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a166"></a><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn652" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref652"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">164</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We find then, in the first 45 years of the
English cotton trade, from 1770 to 1815, only 5 years of crisis and stagnation;
but this was the period of monopoly. The second period from 1815 to 1863
counts, during its 48 years, only 20 years of revival and prosperity against 28
of depression and stagnation. Between 1815 and 1830 the competition with the
continent of Europe and with the United States sets in. After 1833, the
extension of the Asiatic markets is enforced by “destruction of the human race”
(the wholesale extinction of Indian hand-loom weavers). After the repeal of the
Corn Laws, from 1846 to 1863, there are 8 years of moderate activity and
prosperity against 9 years of depression and stagnation. The condition of the
adult male operatives, even during the years of prosperity, may be judged from
the note subjoined.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn653" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref653"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">165</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">A. Overthrow of Co-operation Based
on Handicraft and on the Division of Labour</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We have
seen how machinery does away with co-operation based on handicrafts, and with
manufacture based on the division of handicraft labour. An example of the first
sort is the mowing-machine; it replaces co-operation between mowers. A striking
example of the second kind, is the needle-making machine. According to Adam
Smith, 10 men, in his day, made in co-operation, over 48,000 needles a-day. On
the other hand, a single needle-machine makes 145,000 in a working day of 11
hours. One woman or one girl superintends four such machines, and so produces
near upon 600,000 needles in a day, and upwards of 3,000,000 in a week.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn654" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref654"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">166</span></a> A single machine, when it takes the
place of co-operation or of manufacture, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a168"></a>may itself serve as
the basis of an industry of a handicraft character. Still, such a return to
handicrafts is but a transition to the factory system, which, as a rule, makes
its appearance so soon as the human muscles are replaced, for the purpose of
driving the machines, by a mechanical motive power, such as steam or water.
Here and there, but in any case only for a time, an industry may be carried on,
on a small scale, by means of mechanical power. This is effected by hiring
steam-power, as is done in some of the Birmingham trades, or by the use of
small caloric-engines, as in some branches of weaving.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn655" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref655"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">167</span></a> In the Coventry silk <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a169"></a>weaving
industry the experiment of “cottage factories” was tried. In the centre of a
square surrounded by rows of cottages, an engine-house was built and the engine
connected by shafts with the looms in the cottages. In all cases the power was
hired at so much per loom. The rent was payable weekly, whether the looms
worked or not. Each cottage held from 2 to 6 looms; some belonged to the
weaver, some were bought on credit, some were hired. The struggle between these
cottage factories and the factory proper, lasted over 12 years. It ended with
the complete ruin of the 300 cottage factories.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn656" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref656"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">168</span></a>
Wherever the nature of the process did not involve production on a large scale,
the new industries that have sprung up in the last few decades, such as
envelope making, steel-pen making, &amp;c., <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a170"></a>have, as a general
rule, first passed through the handicraft stage, and then the manufacturing
stage, as short phases of transition to the factory stage. The transition is
very difficult in those cases where the production of the article by
manufacture consists, not of a series of graduated processes, but of a great
number of disconnected ones. This circumstance formed a great hindrance to the
establishment of steel-pen factories. Nevertheless, about 15 years ago, a
machine was invented that automatically performed 6 separate operations at
once. The first steel-pens were supplied by the handicraft system, in the year
1820, at £7 4s. the gross; in 1830 they-were supplied by manufacture at 8s.,
and today the factory system supplies them to the trade at from 2 to 6d. the
gross.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn657" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref657"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">16</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span> </span></p>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">B. Reaction of the Factory System
on Manufacture and Domestic Industries</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Along with
the development of the factory system and of the revolution in agriculture that
accompanies it, production in all the other branches of industry not only
extends, but alters its character. The principle, carried out in the factory
system, of analysing the process of production into its constituent phases, and
of solving the problems thus proposed by the application of mechanics, of
chemistry, and of the whole range of the natural sciences, becomes the
determining principle everywhere. Hence, machinery squeezes itself into the
manufacturing industries first for one detail process, then for another. Thus
the solid crystal of their organisation, based on the old division of labour,
becomes dissolved, and makes way for constant changes. Independently of this, a
radical change takes place in the composition of the collective labourer, a
change of the persons working in combination. In contrast with the
manufacturing period, the division of labour is thenceforth based, wherever
possible, on the employment of women, of children of all ages, and of unskilled
labourers, in one word, on cheap labour, as it is characteristically called in
England. This is the case not only with all production on a large scale,
whether employing machinery or not, but also with the so-called domestic
industry, whether carried on in the houses of the workpeople or in small
workshops. This modern so-called domestic industry has nothing, except the
name, in common with the old-fashioned domestic industry, the existence of
which pre-supposes independent urban handicrafts, independent peasant farming,
and above all, a dwelling-house for the labourer and his family. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a171"></a>That
old-fashioned industry has now been converted into an outside department of the
factory, the manufactory, or the warehouse. Besides the factory operatives, the
manufacturing workmen and the handicraftsman, whom it concentrates in large
masses at one spot, and directly commands, capital also sets in motion, by
means, of invisible threads, another army; that of the workers in the domestic
industries, who dwell in the large towns and are also scattered over the face
of the country. An example: The shirt factory of Messrs. Tillie at Londonderry,
which employs 1,000 operatives in the factory itself, and 9,000 people spread
up and down the country and working in their own houses.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn658" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref658"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">170</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
exploitation of cheap and immature labour-power is carried out in a more
shameless manner in modern Manufacture than in the factory proper. This is
because the technical foundation of the factory system, namely, the
substitution of machines for muscular power, and the light character of the
labour, is almost entirely absent in Manufacture, and at the same time women
and over-young children are subjected, in a most unconscionable way, to the
influence of poisonous or injurious substances. This exploitation is more
shameless in the so-called domestic industry than in manufactures, and that
because the power of resistance in the labourers decreases with their
dissemination; because a whole series of plundering parasites insinuate
themselves between the employer and the workman; because a domestic industry
has always to compete either with the factory system, or with manufacturing in
the same branch of production; because poverty robs the workman of the
conditions most essential to his labour, of space, light and ventilation;
because employment becomes more and more irregular; and, finally, because in
these the last resorts of the masses made “redundant” by modern industry and
Agriculture, competition for work attains its maximum. Economy in the means of
production, first systematically carried out in the factory system, and there,
from the very beginning, coincident with the most reckless squandering of
labour-power, and robbery of the conditions normally requisite for labour –
this economy now shows its antagonistic and murderous side more and more in a
given branch of industry, the less the social productive power of labour and
the technical basis for a combination of processes are developed in that
branch. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I now proceed, by a few examples, to illustrate
the principles laid down above. As a matter of fact, the reader is already
familiar with numerous instances given in the chapter on the working day. In
the hardware manufactures of Birmingham and the neighbourhood, there are
employed, mostly in very heavy work, 30,000 children and young persons, besides
10,000 women. There they are to be seen in the unwholesome brass-foundries,

is well known that Great Britain, apart from its own immense store of rags, is
the emporium for the rag trade of the whole world. They flow in from Japan,
from the most remote States of South America, and from the Canary Islands. But
the chief sources of their supply are Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Egypt,
Turkey, Belgium, and Holland. They are used for manure, for making bedflocks,
for shoddy, and they serve as the raw material of paper. The rag-sorters are
the medium for the spread of small-pox and other infectious diseases, and they
themselves are the first victims.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn662" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref662"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">174</span></a>
A classical example of over-work, of hard and inappropriate labour, and of its
brutalising effects on the workman from his childhood upwards, is afforded not only
by coal-mining and miners generally, but also by tile and brick making, in
which industry the recently invented machinery is, in England, used only here
and there. Between May and September the work lasts from 5 in the morning till
8 in the evening, and where the drying is done in the open air, it often lasts
from 4 in the morning till 9 in the evening. Work from 5 in the morning till 7
in the evening is considered “reduced” and “moderate.” Both boys and girls of 6
and even of 4 years of age are employed. They work for the same number of
hours, often longer, than the adults. The work is hard and the summer heat
increases the exhaustion. In a certain tile-field at Mosley, e.g., a young
woman, 24 years of age, was in the habit of making 2,000 tiles a day, with the
assistance of 2 little girls, who carried the clay for her, and stacked the
tiles. These girls carried daily 10 tons up the slippery sides of the clay
pits, from a depth of 30 feet, and then for a distance of 210 feet.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“It is
impossible for a child to pass through the purgatory of a tile-field without
great moral degradation... the low language, which they are accustomed to hear
from their tenderest years, the filthy, indecent, and shameless habits, amidst
which, unknowing, and half wild, they grow up, make them in after-life lawless,
abandoned, dissolute.... A frightful source of demoralisation is the mode of
living. Each moulder, who is always a skilled labourer, and the chief of a
group, supplies his 7 subordinates with board and lodging in his cottage. Whether
members of his family or not, the men, boys, and girls all sleep in the
cottage, which contains generally two, exceptionally 3 rooms, all on the ground
floor, and badly ventilated. These people are so exhausted after the day’s hard
work, that neither the rules of health, of cleanliness, nor of decency are in
the least observed. Many of these cottages are models of untidiness, dirt, and
dust.... The greatest evil of the system that employs young girls on this sort
of work, consists in this, that, as a rule, it chains them fast from childhood
for the whole of their after-life to the most abandoned rabble. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a176"></a>They
become rough, foul-mouthed boys, before Nature has taught them that they are
women. Clothed in a few dirty rags, the legs naked far above the knees, hair
and face besmeared with dirt, they learn to treat all feelings of decency and
of shame with contempt. During meal-times they lie at full length in the
fields, or watch the boys bathing in a neighbouring canal. Their heavy day’s
work at length completed, they put on better clothes, and accompany the men to
the public houses.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">That excessive insobriety is prevalent from
childhood upwards among the whole of this class, is only natural.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The worst is
that the brickmakers despair of themselves. You might as well, said one of the
better kind to a chaplain of Southallfield, try to raise and improve the devil
as a brickie, sir!”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn663" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref663"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">175</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As to the manner, in which capital effects an
economy in the requisites of labour, in modern Manufacture (in which I include
all workshops of larger size, except factories proper), official and most ample
material bearing on it is to be found in the Public Health Reports IV. (1863)
and VI. (1864). The description of the workshops, more especially those of the
London printers and tailors, surpasses the most loathsome phantasies of our
romance writers. The effect on the health of the workpeople is self-evident.
Dr. Simon, the chief medical officer of the Privy Council and the official
editor of the “Public Health Reports,” says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“In my fourth
Report (1863) I showed, how it is practically impossible for the workpeople to
insist upon that which is their first sanitary right, viz., <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a178"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a177"></a>the right that, no matter what the work for which their employer
brings them together, the labour, so far as it depends upon him, should be
freed from all avoidably unwholesome conditions. I pointed out, that while the
workpeople are practically incapable of doing themselves this sanitary justice,
they are unable to obtain any effective support from the paid administrations
of the sanitary police.... The life of myriads of workmen and workwomen is now
uselessly tortured and shortened by the never-ending physical suffering that
their mere occupation begets.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn664" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref664"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">176</span></a> </span></p>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">D. Modern Domestic Industry</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I now come to the so-called domestic industry.
In order to get an idea of the horrors of this sphere, in which capital
conducts its exploitation in the background of modern mechanical industry, one
must go to the apparently quite idyllic trade of nail-making,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn666" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref666"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">178</span></a> carried on in a few remote villages of
England. In this place, however, it will be enough to give a few examples from
those branches of the lace-making and straw-plaiting industries that are not
yet carried on by the aid of machinery, and that as yet do not compete with branches
carried on in factories or in manufactories. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Of the 150,000 persons employed in England in
the production of lace, about 10,000 fall under the authority of the Factory
Act, 1861. Almost the whole of the remaining 140,000 are women, young persons,
and children of both sexes, the male sex, however, being weakly represented.
The state of health of this cheap material for exploitation will be seen from
the following table, computed by Dr. Trueman, physician to the Nottingham
General Dispensary. Out of 686 female patients who were lace-makers, most of
them between the ages of 17 and 24, the number of consumptive ones were: <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a180"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This progress in the rate of consumption ought
to suffice for the most optimist of progressists, and for the biggest hawker of
lies among the Free-trade bagmen of Germany. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Factory Act of 1861 regulates the actual
making of the lace, so far as it is done by machinery, and this is the rule in
England. The branches that we are now about to examine, solely with regard to
those of the workpeople who work at home, and not those who work in
manufactories or warehouses, fall into two divisions, viz. (1), finishing; (2),
mending. The former gives the finishing touches to the machine-made lace, and
includes numerous sub-divisions. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The lace finishing is done either in what are
called “mistresses’ houses,” or by women in their own houses, with or without
the help of their children. The women who keep the “mistresses’ houses” are
themselves poor. The workroom is in a private house. The mistresses take orders
from manufacturers, or from warehousemen, and employ as many women, girls, and
young children as the size of their rooms and the fluctuating demand of the
business will allow. The number of the workwomen employed in these workrooms
varies from 20 to 40 in some, and from 10 to 20 in others. The average age at
which the children commence work is six years, but in many cases it is below
five. The usual working-hours are from 8 in the morning till eight in the
evening, with 1½ hours for meals, which are taken at irregular intervals, and
often in the foul workrooms. When business is brisk, the labour frequently
lasts from 8 or even 6 o’clock in the morning till 10, 11, or 12 o’clock at
night. In English barracks the regulation space allotted to each soldier is
500-600 cubic feet, and in the military hospitals 1,200 cubic feet. But in
those finishing sties there are but 67 to 100 cubic feet to each person. At the
same time the oxygen of the air is consumed by gas-lights. In order to keep the
lace clean, and although the floor is tiled or gagged, the children are often
compelled, even in winter, to pull off their shoes.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“It is not at
all uncommon in Nottingham to find 14 to 20 children huddled together in a
small room, of, perhaps, not more than 12 feet square, and employed for 15
hours out of the 24, at work that of itself is exhausting, from its weariness
and monotony, and is besides carried on under every possible unwholesome
condition.... Even the very youngest children work with a strained attention
and a rapidity that is astonishing, hardly ever giving their fingers rest or
glowering their motion. If a question be asked them, they never raise their
eyes from their work from fear of losing a single moment.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The “long stick” is used by the mistresses as a
stimulant more and more as the working hours are prolonged. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a182"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a181"></a></span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The children
gradually tire and become as restless as birds towards the end of their long
detention at an occupation that is monotonous, eye-straining, and exhausting
from the uniformity in the posture of the body. Their work is like slavery.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn668" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref668"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">180</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When women and their children work at home,
which now-a-days means in a hired room, often in a garret, the state of things
is, if possible, still worse. This sort of work is given out within a circle of
80 miles radius from Nottingham. On leaving the warehouses at 9 or 10 o’clock
at night, the children are often given a bundle of lace to take home with them
and finish. The Pharisee of a capitalist represented by one of his servants,
accompanies this action, of course, with the unctuous phrase: “That’s for
mother,” yet he knows well enough that the poor children must sit up and help.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn669" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref669"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">181</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Pillow lace-making is chiefly carried on in
England in two agricultural districts; one, the Honiton lace district,
extending from 20 to 30 miles along the south coast of Devonshire, and
including a few places in North Devon; the other comprising a great part of the
counties of Buckingham, Bedford, and Northampton, and also the adjoining
portions of Oxfordshire and Huntingdonshire. The cottages of the agricultural
labourers are the places where the work is usually carried on. Many
manufacturers employ upwards of 3,000 of these lace-makers, who are chiefly
children and young persons of the female sex exclusively. The state of things
described as incidental to lace finishing is here repeated, save that instead
of the “mistresses’ houses,” we find what are called “lace-schools,” kept by
poor women in their cottages. From their fifth year and often earlier, until
their twelfth or fifteenth year, the children work in these schools; during the
<a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a183"></a>first year the very young ones work from four to eight hours,
and later on, from six in the morning till eight and ten o’clock at night.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The rooms
are generally the ordinary living rooms of small cottages, the chimney stopped
up to keep out draughts, the inmates kept warm by their own animal heat alone,
and this frequently in winter. In other cases, these so-called school-rooms are
like small store-rooms without fire-places.... The over-crowding in these dens
and the consequent vitiation of the air are often extreme. Added to this is the
injurious effect of drains, privies, decomposing substances, and other filth
usual in the purlieus of the smaller cottages.” With regard to space: “In one
lace-school 18 girls and a mistress, 35 cubic feet to each person; in another,
where the smell was unbearable, 18 persons and 24½ cubic feet per head. In this
industry are to be found employed children of 2 and 2½ years.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn670" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref670"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">182</span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre12"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Where lace-making ends in the counties of
Buckingham and Bedford, straw-plaiting begins, and extends over a large part of
Hertfordshire and the westerly and northerly parts of Essex. In 1861, there
were 40,043 persons employed in straw-plaiting and straw-hat making; of these
3,815 were males of all ages, the rest females, of whom 14,913, including about
7,000 children, were under 20 years of age. In the place of the lace-schools we
find here the “straw-plait schools.” The children commence their instruction in
straw-plaiting generally in their 4th, often between their 3rd and 4th year.
Education, of course, they get none. The children themselves call the
elementary schools, “natural schools,” to distinguish them from these
blood-sucking institutions, in which they are kept at work simply to get
through the task, generally 30 yards daily, prescribed by their half-starved
mothers. These same mothers often make them work at home, after school is over,
till 10, 11, and 12 o’clock at night. The straw cuts their mouths, with which
they constantly moisten it, and their fingers. Dr. Ballard gives it as the
general opinion of the whole body of medical officers in London, that 300 cubic
feet is the minimum space proper for each person in a bedroom or workroom. But
in the straw-plait schools space is more sparingly allotted than in the
lace-schools, “12 2/3, 17, 18½ and below 22 cubic feet for each person.” </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The smaller
of these numbers, says one of the commissioners, Mr. White, represents less
space than the half of what a child would occupy if packed in a <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a184"></a>box
measuring 3 feet in each direction.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thus do the children enjoy life till the age of
12 or 14. The wretched half-starved parents think of nothing but getting as
much as possible out of their children. The latter, as soon as they are grown
up, do not care a farthing, and naturally so, for their parents, and leave
them.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“It is no
wonder that ignorance and vice abound in a population so brought up.... Their
morality is at the lowest ebb,... a great number of the women have illegitimate
children, and that at such an immature age that even those most conversant with
criminal statistics are astounded.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn671" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref671"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">183</span></a>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Wages in the above industries, miserable as they
are (the maximum wages of a child in the straw-plait schools rising in rare
cases to 3 shillings), are reduced far below their nominal amount by the
prevalence of the truck system everywhere, but especially in the lace
districts.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn672" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref672"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">184</span></a> </span></p>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">E. Passage of Modern Manufacture,
and Domestic Industry into Modern Mechanical Industry. The Hastening of this
Revolution by the Application of the Factory Acts to those Industries</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The cheapening of labour-power, by sheer abuse
of the labour of women and children, by sheer robbery of every normal condition
requisite for working and living, and by the sheer brutality of overwork and
night-work, meets at last with natural obstacles that cannot be overstepped. So
also, when based on these methods, do the cheapening of commodities and
capitalist exploitation in general. So soon as this point is at last reached –
and it takes many years – the hour has struck for the introduction of
machinery, and for the thenceforth rapid conversion of the scattered domestic
industries and also of manufactures into factory industries. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An example, on the most colossal scale, of this
movement is afforded by the production of wearing apparel. This industry,
according to the classification of the Children’s Employment Commission,
comprises straw-hat makers, ladies’-hat makers, cap-makers, tailors, milliners
and dressmakers, shirt-makers, corset-makers, glove-makers, shoemakers, besides
many minor branches, such as the making of neck-ties, collars, &amp;c. In 1861,
the number of females employed in these industries, in England and Wales, amounted
to 586,299, of these 115,242 at the least were under 20, and 16,650. under 15
years of age. The number of these workwomen in the United Kingdom in 1861, was
750,334. The number of males employed in England and Wales, in hat-making,
shoemaking, glove-making and tailoring was 437,969; of these 14,964 under 15
years, 89,285 between 15 and 20, and 333,117 over 20 years. Many of the smaller
branches are not included in these figures. But take the figures as they stand;
we then have for England and Wales alone, according to the census of 1861, a
total of 1,024,277 persons, about as many as are absorbed by agriculture and
cattle breeding. We begin to understand what becomes of the immense quantities
of goods conjured up by the magic of machinery, and of the enormous masses of
workpeople, which that machinery sets free. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a186"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The production of wearing apparel is carried on
partly in manufactories in whose workrooms there is but a reproduction of that
division of labour, the membra disjecta of which were found ready to hand;
partly by small master-handicraftsmen; these, however, do not, as formerly,
work for individual consumers, but for manufactories and warehouses, and to
such an extent that often whole towns and stretches of country carry on certain
branches, such as shoemaking, as a speciality; finally, on a very great scale
by the so-called domestic workers, who form an external department of the
manufactories, warehouses, and even of the workshops of the smaller masters.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn673" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref673"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">185</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a187"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The raw material, &amp;c., is supplied by mechanical
industry, the mass of cheap human material (taillable à merci et miséricorde)
is composed of the individuals “liberated” by mechanical industry and improved
agriculture. The manufactures of this class owed their origin chiefly to the
capitalist’s need of having at hand an army ready equipped to meet any increase
of demand.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn674" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref674"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">186</span></a> These manufactures,
nevertheless, allowed the scattered handicrafts and domestic industries to
continue to exist as a broad foundation. The great production of surplus-value
in these branches of labour, and the progressive cheapening of their articles,
were and are chiefly due to the minimum wages paid, no more than requisite for
a miserable vegetation, and to the extension of working-time up to the maximum
endurable by the human organism. It was in fact by the cheapness of the human
sweat and the human blood, which were converted into commodities, that the
markets were constantly being extended, and continue daily to be extended; more
especially was this the case with England’s colonial markets, where, besides,
English tastes and habits prevail. At last the critical point was reached. The
basis of the old method, sheer brutality in the exploitation of the workpeople,
accompanied more or less by a systematic division of labour, no longer sufficed
for the extending markets and for the still more rapidly extending competition
of the capitalists. The hour struck for the advent of machinery. The decisively
revolutionary machine, the machine which attacks in an equal degree the whole of
the numberless branches of this sphere of production, dressmaking, tailoring,
shoemaking, sewing, hat-making, and many others, is the sewing-machine. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a188"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Its immediate effect on the workpeople is like
that of all machinery, which, since the rise of modern industry, has seized
upon new branches of trade. Children of too tender an age are sent adrift. The
wage of the machine hands rises compared with that of the house-workers, many
of whom belong to the poorest of the poor. That of the better situated handicraftsman,
with whom the machine competes, sinks. The new machine hands are exclusively
girls and young women. With the help of mechanical force, they destroy the
monopoly that male labour had of the heavier work, and they drive off from the
lighter work numbers of old women and very young children. The overpowering <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a189"></a>competition crushes the weakest of the manual labourers. The
fearful increase in death from starvation during the last 10 years in London
runs parallel with the extension of machine sewing.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn675" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref675"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">187</span></a> The new workwomen turn the machines by
hand and foot, or by hand alone, sometimes sitting, sometimes standing,
according to the weight, size, and special make of the machine, and expend a
great deal of labour-power. Their occupation is unwholesome, owing to the long
hours, although in most cases they are not so long as under the old system.
Wherever the sewing-machine locates itself in narrow and already over-crowded
workrooms, it adds to the unwholesome influences.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“The effect,” says Mr. Lord, “on entering low-ceiled
workrooms in which 30 to 40 machine hands are working is unbearable.... The
heat, partly due to the gas stoves used for warming the irons, is horrible....
Even when moderate hours of work, i.e., from 8 in the morning till 6 in the
evening, prevail in such places, yet 3 or 4 persons fall into a swoon regularly
every day.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn676" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref676"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">188</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The revolution in the industrial methods which
is the necessary result of the revolution in the instruments of production, is
effected by a medley of transition forms. These forms vary according to the
extent to which the sewing-machine has become prevalent in one branch, of
industry or the other, to the time during which it has been in operation, to
the previous condition of the workpeople, to the preponderance of manufacture,
of handicrafts or of domestic industry, to the rent of the workrooms,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn677" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref677"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">189</span></a> &amp;c. In dressmaking, for instance,
where the labour for the most part was already organised, chiefly by simple
co-operation, the sewing-machine at first formed merely a new factor in that
manufacturing industry. In tailoring, shirtmaking, shoemaking, &amp;c., all the
forms are intermingled. Here the factory system proper. There middlemen receive
the raw material from the capitalist <i class="calibre4">en chef</i>, and group around their
sewing-machines, in “chambers” and “garrets,” from 10 to 50 or more workwomen. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a192"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a191"></a>Finally, as is always the case with machinery
when not organised into a system, and when it can also be used in dwarfish
proportions, handicraftsman and domestic workers, along with their families, or
with a little extra labour from without, make use of their own sewing-machines.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn678" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref678"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">190</span></a> The system actually prevalent in England
is, that the capitalist concentrates a large number of machines on his
premises, and then distributes the produce of those machines for further
manipulation amongst the domestic workers.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn679" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref679"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">191</span></a>
The variety of the transition forms, however, does not conceal the tendency to
conversion into the factory system proper. This tendency is nurtured by the
very nature of the sewing-machine, the manifold uses of which push on the
concentration, under one roof, and one management, of previously separated
branches of a trade. It is also favoured by the circumstance that preparatory
needlework, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a194"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a193"></a>and certain other operations, are
most conveniently done on the premises where the machine is at work; as well as
by the inevitable expropriation of the hand sewers, and of the domestic workers
who work with their own machines. This fate has already in part overtaken them.
The constantly increasing amount of capital invested in sewing-machines,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn680" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref680"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">192</span></a> gives the spur to the production of, and
gluts the markets with, machine-made articles, thereby giving the signal to the
domestic workers for the sale of their machines. The overproduction of
sewing-machines themselves, causes their producers, in bad want of a sale, to
let them out for so much a week, thus crushing by their deadly competition the
small owners of machines.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn681" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref681"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">193</span></a>
Constant changes in the construction of the machines, and their ever-increasing
cheapness, depreciate day by day the older makes, and allow of their being sold
in great numbers, at absurd prices, to large capitalists, who alone can thus
employ them at a profit. Finally, the substitution of the steam-engine for man
gives in this, as in all similar revolutions, the finishing blow. At first, the
use of steam power meets with mere technical difficulties, such as unsteadiness
in the machines, difficulty <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a196"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a195"></a>in controlling
their speed, rapid wear and tear of the lighter machines, &amp;c., all of which
are soon overcome by experience.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn682" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref682"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">194</span></a> If, on
the one hand, the concentration of many machines in large manufactories leads
to the use of steam power, on the other hand, the competition of steam with
human muscles hastens on the concentration of workpeople and machines in large
factories. Thus England is at present experiencing, not only in the colossal
industry of making wearing apparel, but in most of the other trades mentioned
above, the conversion of manufacture, of handicrafts, and of domestic work into
the factory system, after each of those forms of production, totally changed
and disorganised under the influence of modern industry, has long ago
reproduced, and even overdone, all the horrors of the factory system, without
participating in any of the elements of social progress it contains.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn683" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref683"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">195</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a198"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a197"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This industrial revolution which takes place
spontaneously, is artificially helped on by the extension of the Factory Acts
to all industries in which women, young persons and children are employed. The
compulsory regulation of the working day as regards its length, pauses,
beginning and end, the system of relays of children, the exclusion of all
children under a certain age, &amp;c., necessitate on the one hand more
machinery<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn684" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref684"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">196</span></a> and the substitution of
steam as a motive power in the place of muscles.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn685" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref685"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">197</span></a>
On the other hand, in order to make up for the loss of time, an expansion
occurs of the means of production used in common, of the furnaces, buildings,
&amp;c., in one word, greater concentration of the means of production and a
correspondingly greater concourse of workpeople. The chief objection,
repeatedly and passionately urged on behalf of each manufacture threatened with
the Factory Act, is in fact this, that in order to continue the business on the
old scale a greater outlay of capital will be necessary. But as regards labour
in the so-called domestic industries and the intermediate forms between them
and Manufacture, so soon as limits are put to the working day and to the
employment of children, those industries go to the wall. Unlimited exploitation
of cheap labour-power is the sole foundation of their power to compete. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One of the essential conditions for the
existence of the factory system, especially when the length of the working day
is fixed, is certainty in the result, i.e., the production in a given time of a
given quantity of commodities, or of a given useful effect. The statutory
pauses in the working day, moreover, imply the assumption that periodical and
sudden cessation of the work does no harm to the article undergoing the process
of production. This certainty in the result, and this possibility of
interrupting the work are, of course, easier to be attained in the purely
mechanical industries than in those in which chemical and physical processes
play a part; as, for instance, in the earthenware trade, in bleaching, dyeing,
baking, and in most of the metal industries. Wherever there is a workingday
without restriction as to length, wherever there is night-work and unrestricted
waste of human life, there the slightest obstacle presented by the nature of
the work to a change for the better is soon looked upon as an everlasting
barrier erected by Nature. No poison kills vermin with more certainty than the
Factory Act removes such everlasting barriers. No one made a greater outcry
over “impossibilities” than our friends the earthenware manufacturers. In 1864,
however, they were brought under the Act, and within sixteen months every
“impossibility” had vanished.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The improved
method,” called forth by the Act, “of making slip by pressure instead of by
evaporation, the newly-constructed stoves for drying the ware in its green
state, &amp;c., are each events of great importance in the pottery art, and
mark an advance which the preceding century could not rival.... <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a200"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a199"></a>It has even considerably reduced the temperature of the stoves
themselves with a considerable saving of fuel, and with a readier effect on the
ware.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn686" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref686"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">198</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In spite of every prophecy, the cost-price of
earthenware did not rise, but the quantity produced did, and to such an extent
that the export for the twelve months, ending December, 1865, exceeded in value
by £138,628 the average of the preceding three years. In the manufacture of
matches it was thought to be an indispensable requirement, that boys, even
while bolting their dinner, should go on dipping the matches in melted
phosphorus, the poisonous vapour from which rose into their faces. The Factory
Act (1864) made the saving of time a necessity, and so forced into existence a
dipping machine, the vapour from which could not come in contact with the
workers.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn687" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref687"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">199</span></a> So, at the present time,
in those branches of the lace manufacture not yet subject to the Factory Act,
it is maintained that the meal-times cannot be regular owing to the different
periods required by the various kinds of lace for drying, which periods vary
from three minutes up to an hour and more. To this the Children’s Employment
Commissioners answer:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The
circumstances of this case are precisely analogous to that of the
paper-stainers, dealt with in our first report. Some of the principal
manufacturers in the trade urged that in consequence of the nature of the
materials used, and their various processes, they would be unable, without
serious loss, to stop for meal-times at any given moment. But it was seen from
the evidence that, by due care and previous arrangement, the apprehended
difficulty would be got over; and accordingly, by clause <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a202"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a201"></a>6 of section 6 of the Factory Acts Extension Act, passed during
this Session of Parliament, an interval of eighteen months is given to them
from the passing of the Act before they are required to conform to the meal
hours, specified by the Factory Acts.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn688" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref688"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">200</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal26"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre12">Hardly had the Act been passed when our friends the
manufacturers found out:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The
inconveniences we expected to arise from the introduction of the Factory Acts
into our branch of manufacture, I am happy to say, have not arisen. We do not
find the production at all interfered with; in short, we produce more in the
same time.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn689" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref689"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">201</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is evident that the English legislature,
which certainly no one will venture to reproach with being overdosed with
genius, has been led by experience to the conclusion that a simple compulsory
law is sufficient to enact away all the so-called impediments, opposed by the
nature of the process, to the restriction and regulation of the working day.
Hence, on the introduction of the Factory Act into a given industry, a period
varying from six to eighteen months is fixed within which it is incumbent on
the manufacturers to remove all technical impediments to the working of the
Act. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a203"></a>Mirabeau’s “Impossible! ne me dites jamais ce bête de
mot!” is particularly applicable to modern technology. But though the Factory
Acts thus artificially ripen the material elements necessary for the conversion
of the manufacturing system into the factory system, yet at the same time,
owing to the necessity they impose for greater outlay of capital, they hasten
on the decline of the small masters, and the concentration of capital.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn690" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref690"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">202</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a204"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Besides the purely technical impediments that
are removable by technical means, the irregular habits of the workpeople
themselves obstruct the regulation of the hours of labour. This is especially
the case where piece-wage predominates, and where loss of time in one part of
the day or week can be made good by subsequent over-time, or by night-work, a
process which brutalises the adult workman, and ruins his wife and children.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn691" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref691"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">203</span></a> Although this absence of regularity in
the expenditure of labour-power is a natural and rude reaction against the
tedium of monotonous drudgery, it originates, also, to a much greater degree
from anarchy in production, anarchy that in its turn pre-supposes unbridled
exploitation of labour-power by the capitalist. Besides the general periodic
changes of the industrial cycle, and the special fluctuations in the markets to
which each industry is subject, we may also reckon what is called “the season,”
dependent either on the periodicity of favourable seasons of the year for
navigation; or on fashion, and the sudden placing of large orders that have to
be executed in the shortest possible time. The habit of giving such orders
becomes more frequent with the extension of railways and telegraphs.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The
extension of the railway system throughout the country <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a205"></a>has
tended very much to encourage giving short notice. Purchasers now come up from
Glasgow, Manchester, and Edinburgh once every fortnight or so to the wholesale
city warehouses which we supply, and give small orders requiring immediate
execution, instead of buying from stock as they used to do. Years ago we were
always able to work in the slack times, so as to meet demand of the next
season, but now no one can say beforehand what will be the demand then.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn692" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref692"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">204</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In those factories and manufactories that are
not yet subject to the Factory Acts, the most fearful over-work prevails
periodically during what is called the season, in consequence of sudden orders.
In the outside department of the factory, of the manufactory, and of the
warehouse, the so-called domestic workers, whose employment is at the best irregular,
are entirely dependent for their raw material and their orders on the caprice
of the capitalist, who, in this industry, is not hampered by any regard for
depreciation of his buildings and machinery, and risks nothing by a stoppage of
work, but the skin of the worker himself. Here then he sets himself
systematically to work to form an industrial reserve force that shall be ready
at a moment’s notice; during one part of the year he decimates this force by
the most inhuman toil, during the other part, he lets it starve for want of
work. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a207"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a206"></a></span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The
employers avail themselves of the habitual irregularity in the homework, when
any extra work is wanted at a push, so that the work goes on till 11, and 12
p.m. or 2 a.m., or as the usual phrase is, “all hours,” and that in localities
where “the stench is enough to knock you down, you go to the door, perhaps, and
open it, but shudder to go further.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn693" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref693"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">205</span></a>
“They are curious men,” said one of the witnesses, a shoemaker, speaking of the
masters, “they think it does a boy no harm to work too hard for half the year,
if he is nearly idle for the other half.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn694" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref694"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">206</span></a>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the same way as technical impediments, so,
too, those “usages which have grown with the growth of trade” were and still
are proclaimed by interested capitalists as obstacles due to the nature of the
work. This was a favourite cry of the cotton lords at the time they were first
threatened with the Factory Acts. Although their industry more than any other
depends on navigation, yet experience has given them the lie. Since then, every
pretended obstruction to business has been treated by the Factory inspectors as
a mere sham.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn695" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref695"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">207</span></a> The thoroughly

Extension in England</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Factory legislation, that first conscious and
methodical reaction of society against the spontaneously developed form of the
process of production, is, as we have seen, just as much the necessary product
of modern industry as cotton yarn, self-actors, and the electric telegraph.
Before passing to the consideration of the extension of that legislation in
England, we shall shortly notice certain clauses contained in the Factory Acts,
and not relating to the hours of work. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Apart from their wording, which makes it easy
for the capitalist to evade them, the sanitary clauses are extremely meagre,
and, in fact, limited to provisions for whitewashing the walls, for insuring
cleanliness in some other matters, for ventilation, and for protection against
dangerous machinery. In the third book we shall return again to the fanatical
opposition of the masters to those clauses which imposed upon them a slight
expenditure on appliances for protecting the limbs of their workpeople, an opposition
that throws a fresh and glaring light on the Free-trade dogma, according to
which, in a society with conflicting interests, each individual necessarily
furthers the common weal by seeking nothing but his own personal advantage! One
example is enough. The reader knows that during the last 20 years, the flax
industry has very much extended, and that, with that extension, the number of
scutching mills in Ireland has increased. In 1864 there were in that country
1,800 of these mills. Regularly in autumn and winter women and “young persons,”
the wives, sons, and daughters of the neighbouring small farmers, a class of
people totally unaccustomed to machinery, are taken from field labour to feed
the rollers of the scutching mills with flax. The accidents, both as regards
number and kind, are wholly unexampled in the history of machinery. In one
scutching mill, at Kildinan, near Cork, there occurred between 1852 and 1856,
six fatal accidents and sixty mutilations; every one of which might have been
prevented by the simplest appliances, at the cost of a few shillings. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a213"></a>Dr. W. White, the certifying surgeon for factories at
Downpatrick, states in his official report, dated the 15th December, 1865:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The serious
accidents at the scutching mills are of the most fearful nature. In many cases
a quarter of the body is torn from the trunk, and either involves death, or a
future of wretched incapacity and suffering. The increase of mills in the
country will, of course, extend these dreadful results, and it will be a great
boon if they are brought under the legislature. I am convinced that by proper
supervision of scutching mills a vast sacrifice of life and limb would be
averted.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn702" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref702"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">214</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a214"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">What could possibly show better the character of
the capitalist mode of production, than the necessity that exists for forcing
upon it, by Acts of Parliament, the simplest appliances for maintaining
cleanliness and health? In the potteries the Factory Act of 1864 “has
whitewashed and cleansed upwards of 200 workshops, after a period of abstinence
from any such cleaning, in many cases of 20 years, and in some, entirely,”
(this is the “abstinence” of the capitalist!) “in which were employed 27,800
artisans, hitherto breathing through protracted days and often nights of
labour, a mephitic atmosphere, and which rendered an otherwise comparatively
innocuous occupation, pregnant with disease and death. The Act has improved the
ventilation very much.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn703" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref703"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">215</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At the same time, this portion of the Act
strikingly shows that the capitalist mode of production, owing to its very
nature, excludes all rational improvement beyond a certain point. It has been
stated over and over again that the English doctors are unanimous in declaring
that where the work is continuous, 500 cubic feet is the very least space that should
be allowed for each person. Now, if the Factory Acts, owing to their compulsory
provisions, indirectly hasten on the conversion of small workshops into
factories, thus indirectly attacking the proprietary rights of the smaller
capitalists, and assuring a monopoly to the great ones, so, if it were made
obligatory to provide the proper space for each workman in every workshop,
thousands of small <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a215"></a>employers would, at one full swoop, be
expropriated directly! The very root of the capitalist mode of production,
i.e., the self-expansion of all capital, large or small, by means of the “free”
purchase and consumption of labour-power, would be attacked. Factory
legislation is therefore brought to a deadlock before these 500 cubic feet of
breathing space. The sanitary officers, the industrial inquiry commissioners,
the factory inspectors, all harp, over and over again, upon the necessity for
those 500 cubic feet, and upon the impossibility of wringing them out of
capital. They thus, in fact, declare that consumption and other lung diseases
among the workpeople are necessary conditions to the existence of capital.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn704" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref704"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">216</span></a> <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a218"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a217"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a216"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Paltry as the education clauses of the Act
appear on the whole, yet they proclaim elementary education to be an
indispensable condition to the employment of children.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn705" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref705"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">217</span></a> The success of those clauses proved for
the first time the possibility of combining education and gymnastics<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn706" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref706"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">218</span></a> with manual labour, and, consequently,
of combining manual labour with education and gymnastics. The factory
inspectors soon found out by questioning the schoolmasters, that the factory
children, although receiving only one half the education of the regular day
scholars, yet learnt quite as much and often more.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“This can be
accounted for by the simple fact that, with only being at school for one half
of the day, they are always fresh, and nearly always ready and willing to
receive instruction. The system on which they work, half manual labour, and
half school, renders each employment a rest and a relief to the other; consequently,
both are far more congenial to the child, than would <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a219"></a>be the
case were he kept constantly at one. It is quite clear that a boy who has been
at school all the morning, cannot (in hot weather particularly) cope with one
who comes fresh and bright from his work.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn707" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref707"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">219</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Further
information on this point will be found in Senior’s speech at the Social
Science Congress at Edinburgh in 1863. He there shows, amongst other things,
how the monotonous and uselessly long school hours of the children of the upper
and middle classes, uselessly add to the labour of the teacher, “while he not
only fruitlessly but absolutely injuriously, wastes the time, health, and
energy of the children.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn708" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref708"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">220</span></a> From
the Factory system budded, as Robert Owen has shown us in detail, the germ of
the education of the future, an education that will, in the case of every child
over a given age, combine productive labour with instruction and gymnastics,
not only as one of the methods of adding to the efficiency of production, but
as the only method of producing fully developed human beings. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a220"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Modern
industry, as we have seen, sweeps away by technical means the manufacturing
division of labour, under which each man is bound hand and foot for life to a
single detail-operation. At the same time, the capitalistic form of that
industry reproduces this same division of labour in a still more monstrous
shape; in the factory proper, by converting the workman into a living appendage
of the machine; and everywhere outside the Factory, partly by the sporadic use
of machinery and machine workers,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn709" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref709"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">221</span></a>
partly by re-establishing the division of labour on a fresh basis by the
general introduction of the labour of women and children, and of cheap
unskilled labour. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
antagonism between the manufacturing division of labour and the methods of
modern industry makes itself forcibly felt. It manifests itself, amongst other
ways, in the frightful fact that a great part of the children employed in
modern factories and manufactures, are from their earliest years riveted to the
most simple manipulations, and exploited for years, without being taught a
single sort of work that would afterwards make them of use, even in the same
manufactory or factory. In the English letter-press printing trade, for
example, there existed formerly a system, corresponding to that in the old
manufactures and handicrafts, of advancing the apprentices from easy to more
and more difficult work. They went through a course of teaching till they were
finished printers. To be able to read and write was for every one of them a
requirement of their trade. All this was changed by the printing machine. It
employs two sorts of labourers, one grown up, renters, the other, boys mostly
from 11 to 17 years of age whose sole business is either to spread the sheets
of paper under the machine, or to take from it the printed sheets. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a222"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a221"></a>They perform this weary task, in London
especially, for 14, 15, and 16 hours at a stretch, during several days in the
week, and frequently for 36 hours, with only 2 hours’ rest for meals and sleep.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn710" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref710"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">222</span></a> A great part of them cannot read, and
they are, as a rule, utter savages and very extraordinary creatures.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“To qualify
them for the work which they have to do, they require no intellectual training;
there is little room in it for skill, and less for judgment; their wages,
though rather high for boys, do not increase proportionately as they grow up,
and the majority of them cannot look for advancement to the better paid and
more responsible post of machine minder, because while each machine has but one
minder, it has at least two, and often four boys attached to it.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn711" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref711"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">223</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As soon as they get too old for such child’s
work, that is about 17 at the latest, they are discharged from the printing
establishments. They become recruits of crime. Several attempts to procure them
employment elsewhere, were rendered of no avail by their ignorance and
brutality, and by their mental and bodily degradation. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a223"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As with the division of labour in the interior
of the manufacturing workshops, so it is with the division of labour in the
interior of society. So long as handicraft and manufacture form the general
groundwork of social production, the subjection of the producer to one branch
exclusively, the breaking up of the multifariousness of his employment<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn712" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref712"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">224</span></a> is a necessary step in the development.
On that groundwork each separate branch of production acquires empirically the
form that is technically suited to it, slowly perfects it, and, so soon as a
given degree of maturity has been reached, rapidly crystallises that form. The
only thing, that here and there causes a change, besides new raw material
supplied by commerce, is the gradual alteration of the instruments of labour.
But their form, too, once definitely <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a224"></a>settled by experience,
petrifies, as is proved by their being in many cases handed down in the same
form by one generation to another during thousands of years. A characteristic
feature is, that, even down into the eighteenth century, the different trades
were called “mysteries” (mystères);<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn713" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref713"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">225</span></a>
into their secrets none but those duly initiated could penetrate. modern
industry rent the veil that concealed from men their own social process of
production, and that turned the various, spontaneously divided branches of
production into so many riddles, not only to outsiders, but even to the
initiated. The principle which it pursued, of resolving each process into its
constituent movements, without any regard to their possible execution by the
hand of man, created the new modern science of technology. The varied,
apparently unconnected, and petrified forms of the industrial processes now
resolved themselves into so many conscious and systematic applications of
natural science to the attainment of given useful effects. Technology also
discovered the few main fundamental forms of motion, which, despite the
diversity of the instruments used, are necessarily taken by every productive
action of the human body; just as the science of mechanics sees in the most
complicated machinery nothing but the continual repetition of the simple mechanical
powers. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Modern
industry never looks upon and treats the existing form of a process as final.
The technical basis of that industry is therefore revolutionary, while all
earlier modes of production were essentially conservative.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn714" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref714"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">226</span></a> By means of machinery, chemical
processes and other methods, it is continually causing changes not only in the
technical basis of production, but also in the functions of the labourer, and
in the social combinations of the labour-process. At the same time, it thereby
also revolutionises the division of labour within the society, and incessantly
launches masses of capital and of workpeople from one branch of production to
another. But if modern industry, by its very nature, therefore necessitates
variation of labour, fluency of function, universal mobility of the labourer,
on the other hand, in its capitalistic form, it reproduces the old division of
labour with its ossified particularisations. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a226"></a>We have seen how
this absolute contradiction between the technical necessities of modern
industry, and the social character inherent in its capitalistic form, dispels
all fixity and security in the situation of the labourer; how it constantly
threatens, by taking away the instruments of labour, to snatch from his hands
his means of subsistence,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn715" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref715"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">227</span></a> and, by
suppressing his detail-function, to make him superfluous. We have seen, too,
how this antagonism vents its rage in the creation of that monstrosity, an
industrial reserve army, kept in misery in order to <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a227"></a>be always
at the disposal of capital; in the incessant human sacrifices from among the
working-class, in the most reckless squandering of labour-power and in the
devastation caused by a social anarchy which turns every economic progress into
a social calamity. This is the negative side. But if, on the one hand,
variation of work at present imposes itself after the manner of an overpowering
natural law, and with the blindly destructive action of a natural law that
meets with resistance<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn716" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref716"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">228</span></a> at all
points, modern industry, on the other hand, through its catastrophes imposes
the necessity of recognising, as a fundamental law of production, variation of
work, consequently fitness of the labourer for varied work, consequently the
greatest possible development of his varied aptitudes. It becomes a question of
life and death for society to adapt the mode of production to the normal
functioning of this law. Modern Industry, indeed, compels society, under
penalty of death, to replace the detail-worker of to-day, grappled by life-long
repetition of one and the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to the mere
fragment of a man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a variety of
labours, ready to face any change of production, and to whom the different
social functions he performs, are but so many modes of giving free scope to his
own natural and acquired powers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One step already spontaneously taken towards
effecting this revolution is the establishment of technical and agricultural
schools, and of “écoles d’enseignement professionnel,” in which the children of
the working-men receive some little instruction in technology and in the
practical handling of the various implements of labour. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a228"></a>Though
the Factory Act, that first and meagre concession wrung from capital, is
limited to combining elementary education with work in the factory, there can
be no doubt that when the working-class comes into power, as inevitably it
must, technical instruction, both theoretical and practical, will take its
proper place in the working-class schools. There is also no doubt that such
revolutionary ferments, the final result of which is the abolition of the old
division of labour, are diametrically opposed to the capitalistic form of
production, and to the economic status of the labourer corresponding to that
form. But the historical development of the antagonisms, immanent in a given
form of production, is the only way in which that form of production can be
dissolved and a new form established. “Ne sutor ultra crepidam” – this nec plus
ultra of handicraft wisdom became sheer nonsense, from the moment the
watchmaker Watt invented the steam-engine, the barber Arkwright, the throstle,
and the working-jeweller, Fulton, the steamship.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn717" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref717"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">229</span></a>
<a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a229"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So long as Factory legislation is confined to
regulating the labour in factories, manufactories, &amp;c., it is regarded as a
mere interference with the exploiting rights of capital. But when it comes to
regulating the so-called “home-labour,”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn718" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref718"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">230</span></a>
it is immediately viewed as a direct attack on the patria potestas, on parental
authority. The tender-hearted English Parliament long affected to shrink from
taking this step. The force of facts, however, compelled it at last to
acknowledge that modern industry, in overturning the economic foundation on
which was based the traditional family, and the family labour corresponding to
it, had also unloosened all traditional family ties. The rights of the children
had to be proclaimed. The final report of the Ch. Empl. Comm. of 1866, states:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“It is
unhappily, to a painful degree, apparent throughout the whole of the evidence,
that against no persons do the children of both sexes so much require
protection as against their parents.” The system of unlimited exploitation of
children’s labour in general and the so-called home-labour in particular is <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a230"></a>"maintained only because the parents are able, without check
or control, to exercise this arbitrary and mischievous power over their young
and tender offspring.... Parents must not possess the absolute power of making
their children mere ‘machines to earn so much weekly wage....’ The children and
young persons, therefore, in all such cases may justifiably claim from the
legislature, as a natural right, that an exemption should be secured to them,
from what destroys prematurely their physical strength, and lowers them in the
scale of intellectual and moral beings.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn719" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref719"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">231</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was not, however, the misuse of parental
authority that created the capitalistic exploitation, whether direct or
indirect, of children’s labour; but, on the contrary, it was the capitalistic
mode of exploitation which, by sweeping away the economic basis of parental
authority, made its exercise degenerate into a mischievous misuse of power.
However terrible and disgusting the dissolution, under the capitalist system,
of the old family ties may appear, nevertheless, modern industry, by assigning
as it does an important part in the process of production, outside the domestic
sphere, to women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a
new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations
between the sexes. It is, of course, just as absurd to hold the
Teutonic-Christian form of the family to be absolute and final as it would be
to apply that character to the ancient Roman, the ancient Greek, or the <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a231"></a>Eastern forms which, moreover, taken together form a series in
historical development. Moreover, it is obvious that the fact of the collective
working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages, must
necessarily, under suitable conditions, become a source of humane development;
although in its spontaneously developed, brutal, capitalistic form, where the
labourer exists for the process of production, and not the process of
production for the labourer, that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption
and slavery.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn720" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref720"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">232</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The necessity for a generalisation of the
Factory Acts, for transforming them from an exceptional law relating to
mechanical spinning and weaving – those first creations of machinery – into a
law affecting social production as a whole, arose, as we have seen, from the
mode in which modern industry was historically developed. In the rear of that
industry, the traditional form of manufacture, of handicraft, and of domestic
industry, is entirely revolutionised; manufactures are constantly passing into
the factory system, and handicrafts into manufactures; and lastly, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a233"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a232"></a>the spheres of handicraft and of the domestic
industries become, in a, comparatively speaking, wonderfully short time, dens
of misery in which capitalistic exploitation obtains free play for the wildest
excesses. There are two circumstances that finally turn the scale: first, the
constantly recurring experience that capital, so soon as it finds itself
subject to legal control at one point, compensates itself all the more
recklessly at other points;<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn721" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref721"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters">33</span> secondly, the cry of the capitalists for
equality in the conditions of competition, i.e., for equal restrain on all
exploitation of labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn722" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref722"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">234</span></a> On this
point let us listen to two heart-broken cries. Messrs. Cooksley of <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a235"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a234"></a>Bristol, nail and chain, &amp;c., manufacturers,
spontaneously introduced the regulations of the Factory Act into their
business.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“As the old
irregular system prevails in neighbouring works, the Messrs. Cooksley are
subject to the disadvantage of having their boys enticed to continue their labour
elsewhere after 6 p.m. ‘This,’ they naturally say, ‘is an unjustice and loss to
us, as it exhausts a portion of the boy’s strength, of which we ought to have
the full benefit’.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn723" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref723"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">235</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. J. Simpson (paper box and bagmaker, London)
states before the commissioners of the Ch. Empl. Comm.:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“He would
sign any petition for it” (legislative interference)... “As it was, he always
felt restless at night, when he had closed his place, lest others should be
working later than him and getting away his orders.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn724" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref724"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">236</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Summarising, the Ch. Empl. Comm. says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“It would be
unjust to the larger employers that their factories should be placed under
regulation, <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a236"></a>while the hours of labour in the smaller places in
their own branch of business were under no legislative restriction. And to the
injustice arising from the unfair conditions of competition, in regard to
hours, that would be created if the smaller places of work were exempt, would
be added the disadvantage to the larger manufacturers, of finding their supply
of juvenile and female labour drawn off to the places of work exempt from
legislation. Further, a stimulus would be given to the multiplication of the
smaller places of work, which are almost invariably the least favourable to the
health, comfort, education, and general improvement of the people.” <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a237"></a><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn725" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref725"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">237</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In its final report the Commission proposes to
subject to the Factory Act more than 1,400,000 children, young persons, and
women, of which number about one half are exploited in small industries and by
the so-called home-work.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn726" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref726"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">238</span></a><span>  </span>It says,</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“But if it
should seem fit to Parliament to place the whole of that large number of
children, young persons and females under the protective legislation above
adverted to ... it cannot be doubted that such legislation would have a most
beneficent effect, not only upon the young and the feeble, who are its more
immediate objects, but upon the still larger body of adult workers, who would
in all these employments, both directly and indirectly, come immediately under
its influence. It would enforce upon them regular and moderate hours; it would
lead to their places of work being kept in a healthy and cleanly state; it
would therefore husband and improve that store of physical strength on which
their own well-being and that of <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a238"></a>the country so much depends;
it would save the rising generation from that overexertion at an early age
which undermines their constitutions and leads to premature decay; finally, it
would ensure them – at least up to the age of 13 – the opportunity of receiving
the elements of education, and would put an end to that utter ignorance ... so
faithfully exhibited in the Reports of our Assistant Commissioners, and which

twenty years of <i class="calibre4">experimentum in corpore vili</i> had been required. Already
in 1840 a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry on the labour of children had
been appointed. Its Report, in 1842, unfolded, in the words of Nassau W.
Senior,</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“the most
frightful picture of avarice, selfishness and cruelty on the part of masters
and of parents, and of juvenile and infantile misery, degradation and
destruction ever presented.... It may be supposed that it describes the horrors
of a past age. But there is unhappily evidence that those horrors continue as
intense as they were. A pamphlet published by Hardwicke about 2 years ago
states that the abuses complained of in 1842, are in full bloom at the present
day. It is a strange proof of the general neglect of the morals and health of
the children of the working-class, that this report lay unnoticed for 20 years,
during which the children, ‘bred up without the remotest sign of comprehension

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The social conditions having undergone a change,
Parliament could not venture to shelve the demands of the Commission of 1862,
as it had done those of the Commission of 1840. Hence in 1864, when the
Commission had not yet published more than a part of its reports, the
earthenware industries (including the potteries), makers of paperhangings,
matches, cartridges, and caps, and fustian cutters were made subject to the
Acts in force in the textile industries. In the Speech from the Throne, on 5th
February, 1867, the Tory Cabinet of the day announced the introduction of
Bills, founded on the final recommendations of the Commission, which had
completed its labours in 1866. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the 15th August, 1867, the Factory Acts
Extension Act, and on the 21st August, the Workshops’ Regulation Act received
the Royal Assent; the former Act having reference to large industries, the
latter to small. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The former applies to blast-furnaces, iron’ and
copper mills, foundries, machine shops, metal manufactories, gutta-percha works,
paper mills, glass-works, tobacco manufactories, letter-press printing
(including newspapers), book-binding, in short to all industrial establishments
of the above kind, in which 50 individuals or more are occupied simultaneously,
and for not less than 100 days during the year. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To give an idea of the extent of the sphere
embraced by the Workshops’ Regulation Act in its application, we cite from its
interpretation clause, the following passages:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“<i class="calibre4">Handicraft</i>
shall mean any manual labour exercised by way of trade, or for purposes of gain
in, or incidental to, the making any article or part of an article, or in, or
incidental to, the altering, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, or otherwise
adapting for sale any article.” </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“<i class="calibre4">Workshop</i>
shall mean any room or place whatever in the open air or undercover, in which
any handicraft is carried on by any child, young person, or woman, and to which
and over which the person by whom such child, young person, or woman is
employed, has the right of access and control.” </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“<i class="calibre4">Employed</i>
shall mean occupied in any handicraft, whether for wages or not, under a master
or under a parent as herein defined.” </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“<i class="calibre4">Parent</i>
shall mean parent, guardian, or person, having the custody of, or control over,
any... child or young person.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Clause 7, which imposes a penalty for employment
of children, young persons, and women, contrary to the provisions of the Act,
subjects to fines, not only the occupier of the workshop, whether parent or
not, but even</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“the parent
of, or the person deriving any direct benefit from the labour of, or having the
control over, the child, young person or woman.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Factory Acts Extension Act, which affects
the large establishments, derogates from the Factory Act by a crowd of vicious
exceptions and cowardly compromises with the masters. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a242"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Workshops’ Regulation Act, wretched in all
its details, remained a dead letter in the hands of the municipal and local
authorities who were charged with its execution. When, in 1871, Parliament
withdrew from them this power, in order to confer it on the Factory Inspectors,
to whose province it thus added by a single stroke more than one hundred
thousand workshops, and three hundred brickworks, care was taken at the same
time not to add more than eight assistants to their already undermanned staff.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn731" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref731"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">243</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">What strikes us, then, in the English
legislation of 1867, is, on the one hand, the necessity imposed on the
parliament of the ruling classes, of adopting in principle measures so
extraordinary, and on so great a scale, against the excesses of capitalistic
exploitation; and on the other hand, the hesitation, the repugnance, and the
bad faith, with which it lent itself to the task of carrying those measures
into practice. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Inquiry Commission of 1862 also proposed a
new regulation of the mining industry, an industry distinguished from others by
the exceptional characteristic that the interests of landlord and capitalist
there join hands. The antagonism of these two interests had been favourable to
Factory legislation, while on the other hand the absence of that antagonism is
sufficient to explain the delays and chicanery of the legislation on mines. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Inquiry Commission of 1840 had made
revelations so terrible, so shocking, and creating such a scandal all over
Europe, that to salve its conscience Parliament passed the Mining Act of 1842,
in which it limited itself to forbidding the employment underground in mines of
children under 10 years of age and females. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Then another Act, The Mines’ Inspecting Act of
1860, provides that mines shall be inspected by public officers nominated
specially for that purpose, and that boys between the ages of 10 and 12 years
shall not be employed, unless they have a school certificate, or go to school
for a certain number of hours. This Act was a complete dead letter owing to the
ridiculously small number of inspectors, the meagreness of their powers, and
other causes that will become apparent as we proceed. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One of the most recent Blue books on mines is
the “Report from the Select Committee on Mines, together with &amp;c. Evidence,
23rd July, 1866.” This Report is the work of a Parliamentary Committee selected
from members of the House of Commons, and authorised to summon and examine
witnesses. It is a thick folio volume in which the Report itself occupies only
five lines to this effect; that the committee has nothing to say, and that more
witnesses must be examined! </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The mode of examining the witnesses reminds one
of the cross-examination of witnesses in English courts of justice, where the
advocate tries, by means of impudent, unexpected, equivocal and involved
questions, put without connexion, to intimidate, surprise, and confound the
witness, and to give a forced meaning to the answers extorted from him. In this
inquiry the members of the committee themselves are the cross-examiners, and
among them are to be found both mine-owners and mine exploiters; the witnesses
are mostly working coal miners. The whole farce is too characteristic of the
spirit of capital, not to call for a few extracts from this Report. For the
sake of conciseness I have classified them. I may also add that every question
and its answer are numbered in the English Blue books. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN-GB">1. Employment in mines of
boys of 10 years and upwards.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> – In the mines the
work, inclusive of going and returning, usually lasts 14 or 15 hours, sometimes
even from 3, 4 and 5 o’clock a.m., till 5 and 6 o’clock p.m. (n. 6, 452, 83).
The adults work in two shifts, of eight hours each; but there is no alternation
with the boys, on account of the expense (n. 80, 203, 204). The younger boys
are chiefly employed in opening and shutting the ventilating doors in the
various parts of the mine; the older ones are employed on heavier work, in
carrying coal, &amp;c. (n. 122, 739, 1747). They work these long hours
underground until their 18th or 22nd year, when they are put to miner’s work
proper (n. 161). Children and young persons are at present worse treated, and
harder worked than at any previous period (n. 1663-1667). The miners demand
almost unanimously an act of Parliament prohibiting the employment in mines of
children under 14. And now Hussey Vivian (himself an exploiter of mines) asks:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Would not
the opinion of the workman depend upon the poverty of the workman’s family?”
Mr. Bruce: “Do you not think it would be a very hard case, where a parent had
been injured, or where he was sickly, or where a father was dead, and there was
only a mother, to prevent a child between 12 and 14 earning 1s. 7d. a day for
the good of the family? ... You must lay down a general rule? ... Are you prepared
to recommend legislation which would prevent the employment of children under
12 and 14, whatever the state of their parents might be?” “Yes.” (ns. 107-110).
Vivian: “Supposing that an enactment were passed preventing the employment of
children under the age of 14, would it not be probable that ... the parents of
children would seek employment for their children in other directions, for
instance, in manufacture?” “Not generally I think” (n. 174). Kinnaird: “Some of
the boys are keepers of doors?” “Yes.” “Is there not generally a very great
draught every time you open a door or close it?” “Yes, generally there is.” “It
sounds a very easy thing, but it is in fact rather a painful one?” “He is
imprisoned there just the same as if he was in a cell of a gaol.” Bourgeois
Vivian: “Whenever a boy is furnished with a lamp cannot he read?” “Yes, he can
read, if he finds himself in candles.... I suppose he would be found fault with
if he were discovered reading; he is there to mind his business, he has a duty
to perform, and he has to attend to it in the first place, and I do not think
it would be allowed down the pit.” (ns. 139, 141, 143, 158, 160). </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN-GB">II. Education.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> – The working miners want a law for the compulsory
education of their children, as in factories. They declare the clauses of the
Act of 1860, which require a school certificate to be obtained before employing
boys of 10 and 12 years of age, to be quite illusory. The examination of the
witnesses on this subject is truly droll.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Is it (the
Act) required more against the masters or against the parents?” “It is required
against both I think.” “You cannot say whether it is required against one more
than against the other?” “No; I can hardly answer that question.” (ns. 115,
116). “Does there appear to be any desire on the part of the employers that the
boys should have such hours as to enable them to go to school?” “No; the hours
are never shortened for that purpose.” (n. 137) Mr. Kinnaird: “Should you say
that the colliers generally improve their education; have you any instances of
men who have, since they began to work, greatly improved their education, or do
they not rather go back, and lose any advantage that they may have gained?”
“They generally become worse: they do not improve; they acquire bad habits; they
get on to drinking and gambling and such like, and they go completely to
wreck.” (n. 211.) “Do they make any attempt of the kind (for providing
instruction) by having schools at night?” “There are few collieries where night
schools are held, and perhaps at those collieries a few boys do go to those
schools; but they are so physically exhausted that it is to no purpose that
they go there.” (n. 454.) “You are then,” concludes the bourgeois, “against
education?” “Most certainly not; but,” &amp;c. (n. 443.) “But are they (the
employers) not compelled to demand them (school certificates)?” “By law they
are; but I am not aware that they are demanded by the employers.” “Then it is
your opinion, that this provision of the Act as to requiring certificates, is
not generally carried out in the collieries?” “It is not carried out.” (ns.
443, 444.) “Do the men take a great interest in this question (of education)?”
“The majority of them do.” (n. 717.) “Are they very anxious to see the law
enforced?” “The majority are.” (n. 718.) “Do you think that in this country any
law that you pass ... can really be effectual unless the population themselves
assist in putting it into operation?” “Many a man might wish to object to
employing a boy, but he would perhaps become marked by it.” (n. 720.) “Marked
by whom?” “By his employers.” (n. 721.) “Do you think that the employers would
find any fault with a man who obeyed the law... ?” “I believe they would.” (n.
722.) “Have you ever heard of any workman objecting to employ a boy between 10
and 12, who could not write or read?” “It is not left to men’s option.” (n.
123.) “Would you call for the interference of Parliament?” “I think that if
anything effectual is to be done in the education of the colliers’ children, it
will have to be made compulsory by Act of Parliament.” (n. 1634.) “Would you
lay that obligation upon the colliers only, or all the workpeople of Great
Britain?” “I came to speak for the colliers.” (n. 1636.) “Why should you
distinguish them (colliery boys) from other boys?” “Because I think they are an
exception to the rule.” (n. 1638.) “In what respect?” “In a physical respect.”
(n. 1639.) “Why should education be more valuable to them than to other classes
of lads?” “I do not know that it is more valuable; but through the over-exertion
in mines there is less chance for the boys that are employed there to get
education, either at Sunday schools, or at day schools.” (n. 1640.) “It is
impossible to look at a question of this sort absolutely by itself?” (n. 1644.)
“Is there a sufficiency of schools?” – “No"... (n. 1646). “If the State
were to require that every child should be sent to school, would there be
schools for the children to go to?” “No; but I think if the circumstances were
to spring up, the schools would be forthcoming.” (n. 1647.) “Some of them (the
boys) cannot read and write at all, I suppose?” “The majority cannot... The
majority of the men themselves cannot.” (ns. 705, 725.) </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN-GB">III. Employment of women.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> – Since 1842 women are no more employed underground,
but are occupied on the surface in loading the coal, &amp;c., in drawing the
tubs to the canals and railway waggons, in sorting, &amp;c. Their numbers have
considerably increased during the last three or four years. (n. 1727.) They are
mostly the wives, daughters, and widows of the working miners, and their ages
range from 12 to 50 or 60 years. (ns. 645, 1779.)</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre12">“</span><span lang="EN-GB">What is the
feeling among the working miners as to the employment of women?” “I think they
generally condemn it.” (n. 648.) “What objection do you see to it?” “I think it
is degrading to the sex.” (n. 649.) “There is a peculiarity of dress?” “Yes ...
it is rather a man’s dress, and I believe in some cases, it drowns all sense of
decency.” “Do the women smoke?” “Some do.” “And I suppose it is very dirty
work?” “Very dirty.” “They get black and grimy?” “As black as those who are
down the mines ... I believe that a woman having children (and there are plenty
on the banks that have) cannot do her duty to her children.” (ns. 650-654,
701.) “Do you think that those widows could get employment anywhere else, which
would bring them in as much wages as that (from 8s. to 10s. a week)?” “I cannot
speak to that.” (n. 709.) “You would still be prepared, would you,”
(flint-hearted fellow!) “to prevent their obtaining a livelihood by these
means?” “I would.” (n. 710.) “What is the general feeling in the district ...
as to the employment of women?” “The feeling is that it is degrading; and we
wish as miners to have more respect to the fair sex than to see them placed on
the pit bank... Some part of the work is very hard; some of these girls have
raised as much as 10 tons of stuff a day.” (ns. 1715,1717.) “Do you think that
the women employed about the collieries are less moral than the women employed
in the factories?” “. ..the percentage of bad ones may be a little more ...
than with the girls in the factories.” (n. 1237.) “But you are not quite
satisfied with the state of morality in the factories?” “No.” (n. 1733.) “Would
you prohibit the employment of women in factories also?” “No, I would not.” (n.
1734.) “Why not?” “I think it a more honourable occupation for them in the
mills.” (n. 1735.) “Still it is injurious to their morality, you think?” “Not
so much as working on the pit bank; but it is more on the social position I
take it; I do not take it on its moral ground alone. The degradation, in its
social bearing on the girls, is deplorable in the extreme. When these 400 or
500 girls become colliers’ wives, the men suffer greatly from this degradation,
and it causes them to leave their homes and drink.” (n. 1736.) “You would be
obliged to stop the employment of women in the ironworks as well, would you
not, if you stopped it in the collieries?” “I cannot speak for any other
trade.” (n. 1737.) “Can you see any difference in the circumstances of women
employed in ironworks, and the circumstances of women employed above ground in
collieries?” “I have not ascertained anything as to that.” (n. 1740.) “Can you
see anything that makes a distinction between one class and the other?” “I have
not ascertained that, but I know from house to house visitation, that it is a
deplorable state of things in our district....” (n. 1741.) “Would you interfere
in every case with the employment of women where that employment was
degrading?” “It would become injurious, I think, in this way: the best feelings
of Englishmen have been gained from the instruction of a mother. ...” (n.
1750.) “That equally applies to agricultural employments, does it not?” “Yes,
but that is only for two seasons, and we have work all the four seasons.” (n.
1751.) “They often work day and night, wet through to the skin, their
constitution undermined and their health ruined.” “You have not inquired into
that subject perhaps?” “I have certainly taken note of it as I have gone along,
and certainly I have seen nothing parallel to the effects of the employment of
women on the pit bank.... It is the work of a man... a strong man.” (ns. 1753,
1793, 1794.) “Your feeling upon the whole subject is that the better class of
colliers who desire to raise themselves and humanise themselves, instead of
deriving help from the women, are pulled down by them?” “Yes.” (n. 1808.) After
some further crooked questions from these bourgeois, the secret of their
“sympathy” for widows, poor families, &amp;c., comes out at last. “The coal
proprietor appoints certain gentlemen to take the oversight of the workings,
and it is their policy, in order to receive approbation, to place things on the
most economical basis they can, and these girls are employed at from 1s. up to
1s. 6d. a day, where a man at the rate of 2s. 6d. a day would have to be
employed.” (n. 1816.) </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN-GB">IV. Coroner’s inquests. –</span></b></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“With regard
to coroner’s inquests in your district, have the workmen confidence in the
proceedings at those inquests when accidents occur?” “No; they have not.” (n.
360.) “Why not?” “Chiefly because the men who are generally chosen, are men who
know nothing about mines and such like.” “Are not workmen summoned at all upon
the juries?” “Never but as witnesses to my knowledge.” “Who are the people who
are generally summoned upon these juries?” “Generally tradesmen in the
neighbourhood ... from their circumstances they are sometimes liable to be
influenced by their employers ... the owners of the works. They are generally
men who have no knowledge, and can scarcely understand the witnesses who are
called before them, and the terms which are used and such like.” “Would you
have the jury composed of persons who had been employed in mining?” “Yes,
partly... they (the workmen) think that the verdict is not in accordance with
the evidence given generally.” (ns. 361, 364, 366, 368, 371, 375.) “One great
object in summoning a jury is to have an impartial one, is it not?” “Yes, I
should think so.” “Do you think that the juries would be impartial if they were
composed to a considerable extent of workmen?” “I cannot see any motive which
the workmen would have to act partially ... they necessarily have a better
knowledge of the operations in connexion with the mine.” “You do not think
there would be a tendency on the part of the workmen to return unfairly severe
verdicts?” “No, I think not.” (ns. 378, 379, 380.) </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN-GB">V. False weights and
measures.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> – The workmen demand to be paid weekly instead
of fortnightly, and by weight instead of by cubical contents of the tubs; they
also demand protection against the use of false weights, &amp;c. (n. 1071.)</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“If the tubs
were fraudulently increased, a man could discontinue working by giving 14 days’
notice?” “But if he goes to another place, there is the same thing going on
there.” (n. 1071.) “But he can leave that place where the wrong has been
committed?” “It is general; wherever he goes, he has to submit to it.” (n.
1072.) “Could a man leave by giving 14 days’ notice?” “Yes.” (n. 1073.) And yet
they are not satisfied! </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN-GB">VI. Inspection of mines.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> – Casualties from explosions are not the only things
the workmen suffer from. (n. 234, sqq.)</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Our men
complained very much of the bad ventilation of the collieries ... the
ventilation is so bad in general that the men can scarcely breathe; they are
quite unfit for employment of any kind after they have been for a length of
time in connexion with their work; indeed, just at the part of the mine where I
am working, men have been obliged to leave their employment and come home in
consequence of that ... some of them have been out of work for weeks just in
consequence of the bad state of the ventilation where there is not explosive
gas ... there is plenty of air generally in the main courses, yet pains are not
taken to get air into the workings where men are working.” “Why do you not
apply to the inspector?” “To tell the truth there are many men who are timid on
that point; there have been cases of men being sacrificed and losing their
employment in consequence of applying to the inspector.” “Why is he a marked
man for having complained?” “Yes...... And he finds it difficult to get
employment in another mine?” “Yes.” “Do you think the mines in your
neighbourhood are sufficiently inspected to insure a compliance with the
provisions of the Act?” “No; they are not inspected at all ... the inspector
has been down just once in the pit, and it has been going seven years.... In
the district to which I belong there are not a sufficient number of inspectors.
We have one old man more than 70 years of age to inspect more than 130
collieries.” “You wish to have a class of sub-inspectors?” “Yes.” (ns. 234,
241, 251, 254, 274, 275, 554, 276, 293.) “But do you think it would be possible
for Government to maintain such an army of inspectors as would be necessary to do
all that you want them to do, without information from the men?” “No, I should
think it would be next to impossible....” “It would be desirable the inspectors
should come oftener?” “Yes, and without being sent for.” (n. 280, 277.) “Do you
not think that the effect of having these inspectors examining the collieries
so frequently would be to shift the responsibility (!) of supplying proper
ventilation from the owners of the collieries to the Government officials?”
“No, I do not think that, I think that they should make it their business to
enforce the Acts which are already in existence.” (n. 285.) “When you speak of
sub-inspectors, do you mean men at a less salary, and of an inferior stamp to
the present inspectors?” “I would not have them inferior, if you could get them
otherwise.” (n. 294.) “Do you merely want more inspectors, or do you want a
lower class of men as an inspector?” “A man who would knock about, and see that
things are kept right; a man who would not be afraid of himself.” (n. 295.) “If
you obtained your wish in getting an inferior class of inspectors appointed, do
you think that there would be no danger from want of skill, &amp;c?” “I think
not, I think that the Government would see after that, and have proper men in
that position.” (n. 297.)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This kind of examination becomes at last too
much even for the chairman of the committee, and he interrupts with the
observation:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“You want a
class of men who would look into all the details of the mine, and would go into
all the holes and corners, and go into the real facts ... they would report to
the chief inspector, who would then bring his scientific knowledge to bear on
the facts they have stated?” (ns. 298, 299.) “Would it not entail very great
expense if all these old workings were kept ventilated?” “Yes, expense might be
incurred, but life would be at the same time protected.” (n. 531.)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A working miner objects to the 17th section of
the Act of 1860; he says,</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“At the
present time, if the inspector of mines finds a part of the mine unfit to work
in, he has to report it to the mine-owner and the Home Secretary. After doing
that, there is given to the owner 20 days to look over the matter; at the end
of 20 days he has the power to refuse making any alteration in the mine; but,
when he refuses, the mine-owner writes to the Home Secretary, at the same time
nominating five engineers, and from those five engineers named by the
mine-owner himself, the Home Secretary appoints one, I think, as arbitrator, or
appoints arbitrators from them; now we think in that case the mine-owner
virtually appoints his own arbitrator.” (n. 581.)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Bourgeois examiner, himself a mine-owner:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“But ... is
this a merely speculative objection?” (n. 586.) “Then you have a very poor
opinion of the integrity of mining engineers?” “It is most certainly unjust and
inequitable.” (n. 588.) “Do not mining engineers possess a sort of public
character, and do not you think that they are above making such a partial
decision as you apprehend?” “I do not wish to answer such a question as that
with respect to the personal character of those men. I believe that in many
cases they would act very partially indeed, and that it ought not to be in
their hands to do so, where men’s lives are at stake.” (n. 589.)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This same bourgeois is not ashamed to put this
question: “Do you not think that the mine-owner also suffers loss from an
explosion?” Finally, “Are not you workmen in Lancashire able to take care of
your own interests without calling in the Government to help you?” “No.” (n.
1042.) </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the year 1865 there were 3,217 coal mines in
Great Britain, and 12 inspectors. A Yorkshire mine-owner himself calculates (<i class="calibre4">Times</i>,
26th January, 1867), that putting on one side their office work, which absorbs
all their time, each mine can be visited but once in ten years by an inspector.
No wonder that explosions have increased progressively, both in number and
extent (sometimes with a loss of 200-300 men), during the last ten years. These
are the beauties of “free” capitalist production! <i class="calibre4">[This sentence has been

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The very defective Act, passed in 1872, is the
first that regulates the hours of labour of the children employed in mines, and
makes exploiters and owners, to a certain extent, responsible for so-called
accidents. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Royal Commission appointed in 1867 to
inquire into the employment in agriculture of children, young persons, and
women, has published some very important reports. Several attempts to apply the
principles of the Factory Acts, but in a modified form, to agriculture have
been made, but have so far resulted in complete failure. All that I wish to
draw attention to here is the existence of an irresistible tendency towards the
general application of those principles. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If the general extension of factory legislation
to all trades for the purpose of protecting the working-class both in mind and
body has become inevitable, on the other hand, as we have already pointed out,
that extension hastens on the general conversion of numerous isolated small
industries into a few combined industries carried on upon a large scale; it
therefore accelerates the concentration of capital and the exclusive
predominance of the factory system. It destroys both the ancient and the
transitional forms, behind which the dominion of capital is still in part
concealed, and replaces them by the direct and open sway of capital; but
thereby it also generalises the direct opposition to this sway. While in each
individual workshop it enforces uniformity, regularity, order, and economy, it
increases by the immense spur which the limitation and regulation of the
working day give to technical improvement, the anarchy and the catastrophes of
capitalist production as a whole, the intensity of labour, and the competition
of machinery with the labourer. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a243"></a>By the destruction of petty
and domestic industries it destroys the last resort of the “redundant
population,” and with it the sole remaining safety-valve of the whole social
mechanism. By maturing the material conditions, and the combination on a social
scale of the processes of production, it matures the contradictions and
antagonisms of the capitalist form of production, and thereby provides, along
with the elements for the formation of a new society, the forces for exploding
the old one.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn732" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref732"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">244</span></a> </span></p>

Modern Industry and Agriculture</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
revolution called forth by modern industry in agriculture, and in the social
relations of agricultural producers, will be investigated later on. In this
place, we shall merely indicate a few results by way of anticipation. If the
use of machinery in agriculture is for the most part free from the injurious
physical effect it has on the factory operative, its action in superseding the
labourers is more intense, and finds less resistance, as we shall see later in
detail. In the counties of Cambridge and Suffolk, for example, the area of
cultivated land has extended very much within the last 20 years (up to 1868),
while in the same period the rural population has diminished, not only
relatively, but absolutely. In the United States it is as yet only virtually
that agricultural machines replace labourers; in other words, they allow of the
cultivation by the farmer of a larger surface, but do not actually expel the
labourers employed. In 1861 the number of persons occupied in England and Wales
in the manufacture of agricultural machines was 1,034, whilst the number of
agricultural labourers employed in the use of agricultural machines and
steam-engines did not exceed 1,205. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
sphere of agriculture, modern industry has a more revolutionary effect than
elsewhere, for this reason, that it annihilates the peasant, that bulwark of
the old society, and replaces him by the wage-labourer. Thus the desire for
social changes, and the class antagonisms are brought to the same level in the
country as in the towns. The irrational, old-fashioned methods of agriculture
are replaced by scientific ones. Capitalist production completely tears asunder
the old bond of union which held together agriculture and manufacture in their
infancy. But at the same time it creates the material conditions for a higher
synthesis in the future, viz., the union of agriculture and industry on the
basis of the more perfected forms they have each acquired during their
temporary separation. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a244"></a>Capitalist production, by collecting the
population in great centres, and causing an ever-increasing preponderance of
town population, on the one hand concentrates the historical motive power of
society; on the other hand, it disturbs the circulation of matter between man
and the soil, i.e., prevents the return to the soil of its elements consumed by
man in the form of food and clothing; it therefore violates the conditions
necessary to lasting fertility of the soil. By this action it destroys at the
same time the health of the town labourer and the intellectual life of the
rural labourer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn733" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref733"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">245</span></a><span>  </span>But while upsetting the naturally grown
conditions for the maintenance of that circulation of matter, it imperiously
calls for its restoration as a system, as a regulating law of social
production, and under a form appropriate to the full development of the human
race. In agriculture as in manufacture, the transformation of production under
the sway of capital, means, at the same time, the martyrdom of the producer; the
instrument of labour becomes the means of enslaving, exploiting, and
impoverishing the labourer; the social combination and organisation of
labour-processes is turned into an organised mode of crushing out the workman’s
individual vitality, freedom, and independence. The dispersion of the rural
labourers over larger areas breaks their power of resistance while
concentration increases that of the town operatives. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="a245"></a>In modern
agriculture, as in the urban industries, the increased productiveness and
quantity of the labour set in motion are bought at the cost of laying waste and
consuming by disease labour-power itself. Moreover, all progress in
capitalistic agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the
labourer, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the fertility of
the soil for a given time, is a progress towards ruining the lasting sources of
that fertility. The more a country starts its development on the foundation of
modern industry, like the United States, for example, the more rapid is this
process of destruction. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn734" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref734"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">246</span></a>Capitalist
production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of
various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of
all wealth-the soil and the labourer. </span></p>
