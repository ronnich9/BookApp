<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In considering the labour-process, we began (see
</span><span lang="EN-GB">Chapter VII</span><span lang="EN-GB">.) by treating it in the abstract, apart from its
historical forms, as a process between man and Nature. We there stated, “If we
examine the whole labour-process, from the point of view of its result, it is
plain that both the instruments and the subject of labour are means of
production, and that the labour itself is productive labour.” And in Note 2, same
page, we further added: “This method of determining, from the standpoint of the
labour-process alone, what is productive labour, is by no means directly
applicable to the case of the capitalist process of production.” We now proceed
to the further development of this subject.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So far as the labour-process is purely
individual, one and the same labourer unites in himself all the functions, that
later on become separated. When an individual appropriates natural objects for
his livelihood, no one controls him but himself. Afterwards he is controlled by
others. A single man cannot operate upon Nature without calling his own muscles
into play under the control of his own brain. As in the natural body head and
hand wait upon each other, so the labour-process unites the labour of the hand
with that of the head. Later on they part company and even become deadly foes.
The product ceases to be the direct product of the individual, and becomes a
social product, produced in common by a collective labourer, <i class="calibre4">i.e.</i>, by a
combination of workmen, each of whom takes only a part, greater or less, in the
manipulation of the subject of their labour. As the co-operative character of
the labour-process becomes more and more marked, so, as a necessary
consequence, does our notion of productive labour, and of its agent the
productive labourer, become extended. In order to labour productively, it is no
longer necessary for you to do manual work yourself; enough, if you are an
organ of the collective labourer, and perform one of its subordinate functions.
The first definition given above of productive labour, a definition deduced
from the very nature of the production of material objects, still remains
correct for the collective labourer, considered as a whole. But it no longer
holds good for each member taken individually.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the other hand, however, our notion of
productive labour becomes narrowed. Capitalist production is not merely the
production of commodities, it is essentially the production of surplus-value.
The labourer produces, not for himself, but for capital. It no longer suffices,
therefore, that he should simply produce. He must produce surplus-value. That
labourer alone is productive, who produces surplus-value for the capitalist,
and thus works for the self-expansion of capital. If we may take an example
from outside the sphere of production of material objects, a schoolmaster is a
productive labourer when, in addition to belabouring the heads of his scholars,
he works like a horse to enrich the school proprietor. That the latter has laid
out his capital in a teaching factory, instead of in a sausage factory, does
not alter the relation. Hence the notion of a productive labourer implies not
merely a relation between work and useful effect, between labourer and product
of labour, but also a specific, social relation of production, a relation that
has sprung up historically and stamps the labourer as the direct means of
creating surplus-value. To be a productive labourer is, therefore, not a piece
of luck, but a misfortune. In Book IV. which treats of the history of the
theory, it will be more clearly seen, that the production of surplus-value has
at all times been made, by classical political economists, the distinguishing
characteristic of the productive labourer. Hence their definition of a
productive labourer changes with their comprehension of the nature of surplus-value.
Thus the Physiocrats insist that only agricultural labour is productive, since
that alone, they say, yields a surplus-value. And they say so because, with them,
surplus-value has no existence except in the form of rent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The prolongation of the working day beyond the
point at which the labourer would have produced just an equivalent for the
value of his labour-power, and the appropriation of that surplus labour by
capital, this is production of absolute surplus-value. It forms the general
groundwork of the capitalist system, and the starting-point for the production
of relative surplus-value. The latter pre-supposes that the working day is
already divided into two parts, necessary labour, and surplus labour. In order
to prolong the surplus labour, the necessary labour is shortened by methods
whereby the equivalent for the wages is produced in less time. The production
of absolute surplus-value turns exclusively upon the length of the working day;
the production of relative surplus-value, revolutionises out and out the
technical processes of labour, and the composition of society. It therefore
pre-supposes a specific mode, the capitalist mode of production, a mode which,
along with its methods, means, and conditions, arises and develops itself
spontaneously on the foundation afforded by the formal subjection of labour to
capital. In the course of this development, the formal subjection is replaced
by the real subjection of labour to capital.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It will suffice merely to refer to certain
intermediate forms, in which surplus labour is not extorted by direct
compulsion from the producer, nor the producer himself yet formally subjected
to capital. In such forms capital has not yet acquired the direct control of
the labour-process. By the side of independent producers who carry on their
handicrafts and agriculture in the traditional old-fashioned way, there stands
the usurer or the merchant, with his usurer’s capital or merchant’s capital,
feeding on them like a parasite. The predominance, in a society, of this form
of exploitation excludes the capitalist mode of production; to which mode,
however, this form may serve as a transition, as it did towards the close of
the Middle Ages. Finally, as is shown by modern “domestic industry,” some
intermediate forms are here and there reproduced in the background of Modern
Industry, though their physiognomy is totally changed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If, on the one hand, the mere formal subjection
of labour to capital suffices for the production of absolute surplus-value, if,
<i class="calibre4">e.g.</i>, it is sufficient that handicraftsmen who previously worked on
their own account, or as apprentices of a master, should become wage labourers
under the direct control of a capitalist; so, on the other hand, we have seen,
how the methods of producing relative surplus-value, are, at the same time,
methods of producing absolute surplus-value. Nay, more, the excessive
prolongation of the working day turned out to be the peculiar product of Modern
Industry. Generally speaking, the specifically capitalist mode of production
ceases to be a mere means of producing relative surplus-value, so soon as that
mode has conquered an entire branch of production; and still more so, so soon
as it has conquered all the important branches. It then becomes the general,
socially predominant form of production. As a special method of producing
relative surplus-value, it remains effective only, first, in so far as it
seizes upon industries that previously were only formally subject to capital,
that is, so far as it is propagandist; secondly, in so far as the industries
that have been taken over by it, continue to be revolutionised by changes in
the methods of production.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From one standpoint, any distinction between
absolute and relative surplus-value appears illusory. Relative surplus-value is
absolute, since it compels the absolute prolongation of the working day beyond
the labour-time necessary to the existence of the labourer himself. Absolute surplus-value
is relative, since it makes necessary such a development of the productiveness
of labour, as will allow of the necessary labour-time being confined to a
portion of the working day. But if we keep in mind the behaviour of surplus-value,
this appearance of identity vanishes. Once the capitalist mode of production is
established and become general, the difference between absolute and relative surplus-value
makes itself felt, whenever there is a question of raising the rate of surplus-value.
Assuming that labour-power is paid for at its value, we are confronted by this
alternative: given the productiveness of labour and its normal intensity, the
rate of surplus-value can be raised only by the actual prolongation of the
working day; on the other hand, given the length of the working day, that rise
can be effected only by a change in the relative magnitudes of the components
of the working day, viz., necessary labour and surplus labour; a change which,
if the wages are not to fall below the value of labour-power, presupposes a
change either in the productiveness or in the intensity of the labour. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If the labourer wants all his time to produce
the necessary means of subsistence for himself and his race, he has no time
left in which to work gratis for others. Without a certain degree of
productiveness in his labour, he has no such superfluous time at his disposal;
without such superfluous time, no surplus labour, and therefore no capitalists,
no slave-owners, no feudal lords, in one word, no class of large proprietors.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn735" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref735"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thus we may say that surplus-value rests on a
natural basis; but this is permissible only in the very general sense, that
there is no natural obstacle absolutely preventing one man from disburdening
himself of the labour requisite for his own existence, and burdening another
with it, any more, for instance, than unconquerable natural obstacle prevent
one man from eating the flesh of another.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn736" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref736"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a>
No mystical ideas must in any way be connected, as sometimes happens, with this
historically developed productiveness of labour. It is only after men have
raised themselves above the rank of animals, when therefore their labour has
been to some extent socialised, that a state of things arises in which the
surplus labour of the one becomes a condition of existence for the other. At
the dawn of civilisation the productiveness acquired by labour is small, but so
too are the wants which develop with and by the means of satisfying them.
Further, at that early period, the portion of society that lives on the labour
of others is infinitely small compared with the mass of direct producers. Along
with the progress in the productiveness of labour, that small portion of
society increases both absolutely and relatively.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn737" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref737"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a>
Besides, capital with its accompanying relations springs up from an economic
soil that is the product of a long process of development. The productiveness
of labour that serves as its foundation and starting-point, is a gift, not of
nature, but of a history embracing thousands of centuries.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Apart from the degree of development, greater or
less, in the form of social production, the productiveness of labour is
fettered by physical conditions. These are all referable to the constitution of
man himself (race, &amp;c.), and to surrounding nature. The external physical conditions
fall into two great economic classes, (1) Natural wealth in means of
subsistence, <i class="calibre4">i.e.</i>, a fruitful soil, waters teeming with fish, &amp;c.,
and (2), natural wealth in the instruments of labour, such as waterfalls,
navigable rivers, wood, metal, coal, &amp;c. At the dawn of civilisation, it is
the first class that turns the scale; at a higher stage of development, it is
the second. Compare, for example, England with India, or in ancient times,
Athens and Corinth with the shores of the Black Sea. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The fewer the number of natural wants
imperatively calling for satisfaction, and the greater the natural fertility of
the soil and the favourableness of the climate, so much less is the labour-time
necessary for the maintenance and reproduction of the producer. So much greater
therefore can be the excess of his labours for others over his labour for
himself. Diodorus long ago remarked this in relation to the ancient Egyptians.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“It is
altogether incredible how little trouble and expense the bringing up of their
children causes them. They cook for them the first simple food at hand; they
also give them the lower part of the papyrus stem to eat, so far as it can be
roasted in the fire, and the roots and stalks of marsh plants, some raw, some
boiled and roasted. Most of the children go without shoes and unclothed, for
the air is so mild. Hence a child, until he is grown up, costs his parents not
more, on the whole, than twenty drachmas. It is this, chiefly, which explains
why the population of Egypt is so numerous, and, therefore, why so many great
works can be undertaken.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn738" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref738"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Nevertheless the grand structures of ancient
Egypt are less due to the extent of its population than to the large proportion
of it that was freely disposable. Just as the individual labourer can do more
surplus labour in proportion as his necessary labour-time is less, so with
regard to the working population. The smaller the part of it which is required
for the production of the necessary means of subsistence, so much the greater
is the part that can be set to do other work. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Capitalist production once assumed, then, all
other circumstances remaining the same, and given the length of the working
day, the quantity of surplus labour will vary with the physical conditions of
labour, especially with the fertility of the soil. But it by no means follows
from this that the most fruitful soil is the most fitted for the growth of the
capitalist mode of production. This mode is based on the dominion of man over
nature. Where nature is too lavish, she “keeps him in hand, like a child in
leading-strings.” She does not impose upon him any necessity to develop
himself.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn739" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref739"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> It is not the tropics with
their luxuriant vegetation, but the temperate zone, that is the mother-country
of capital. It is not the mere fertility of the soil, but the differentiation
of the soil, the variety of its natural products, the changes of the seasons,
which form the physical basis for the social division of labour, and which, by
changes in the natural surroundings, spur man on to the multiplication of his
wants, his capabilities, his means and modes of labour. It is the necessity of
bringing a natural force under the control of society, of economising, of
appropriating or subduing it on a large scale by the work of man’s hand, that
first plays the decisive part in the history of industry. Examples are, the
irrigation works in Egypt,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn740" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref740"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> Lombardy,
Holland, or in India and Persia where irrigation by means of artificial canals,
not only supplies the soil with the water indispensable to it, but also carries
down to it, in the shape of sediment from the hills, mineral fertilisers. The
secret of the flourishing state of industry in Spain and Sicily under the
dominion of the Arabs lay in their irrigation works.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn741" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref741"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Favourable natural conditions alone, give us only
the possibility, never the reality, of surplus labour, nor, consequently, of surplus-value
and a surplus-product. The result of difference in the natural conditions of
labour is this, that the same quantity of labour satisfies, in different
countries, a different mass of requirements,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn742" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref742"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a>
consequently, that under circumstances in other respects analogous, the
necessary labour-time is different. These conditions affect surplus labour only
as natural limits, <i class="calibre4">i.e.</i>, by fixing the points at which labour for others
can begin. In proportion as industry advances, these natural limits recede. In
the midst of our West European society, where the labourer purchases the right
to work for his own livelihood only by paying for it in surplus labour, the
idea easily takes root that it is an inherent quality of human labour to
furnish a surplus-product.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn743" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref743"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a> But
consider, for example, an inhabitant of the eastern islands of the Asiatic
Archipelago, where sago grows wild in the forests.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“When the
inhabitants have convinced themselves, by boring a hole in the tree, that the
pith is ripe, the trunk is cut down and divided into several pieces, the pith
is extracted, mixed with water and filtered: it is then quite fit for use as
sago. One tree commonly yields 300 lbs., and occasionally 500 to 600 lbs.
There, then, people go into the forests, and cut bread for themselves, just as
with us they cut fire-wood.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn744" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref744"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Suppose now such an eastern bread-cutter
requires 12 working hours a week for the satisfaction of all his wants.
Nature’s direct gift to him is plenty of leisure time. Before he can apply this
leisure time productively for himself, a whole series of historical events is
required; before he spends it in surplus labour for strangers, compulsion is
necessary. If capitalist production were introduced, the honest fellow would
perhaps have to work six days a week, in order to appropriate to himself the
product of one working day. The bounty of Nature does not explain why he would
then have to work 6 days a week, or why he must furnish 5 days of surplus
labour. It explains only why his necessary labour-time would be limited to one
day a week. But in no case would his surplus-product arise from some occult
quality inherent in human labour. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thus, not only does the historically developed
social productiveness of labour, but also its natural productiveness, appear to
be productiveness of the capital with which that labour is incorporated. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Ricardo never concerns himself about the origin
of surplus-value. He treats it as a thing inherent in the capitalist mode of
production, which mode, in his eyes, is the natural form of social production.
Whenever he discusses the productiveness of labour, he seeks in it, not the
cause of surplus-value, but the cause that determines the magnitude of that
value. On the other hand, his school has openly proclaimed the productiveness
of labour to be the originating cause of profit (read: Surplus-value). This at
all events is a progress as against the mercantilists who, on their side,
derived the excess of the price over the cost of production of the product,
from the act of exchange, from the product being sold above its value.
Nevertheless, Ricardo’s school simply shirked the problem, they did not solve
it. In fact these bourgeois economists instinctively saw, and rightly so, that
it is very dangerous to stir too deeply the burning question of the origin of surplus-value.
But what are we to think of John Stuart Mill, who, half a century after
Ricardo, solemnly claims superiority over the mercantilists, by clumsily repeating
the wretched evasions of Ricardo’s earliest vulgarisers? </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mill says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The cause of
profit is that labour produces more than is required for its support.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So far, nothing but the old story; but Mill
wishing to add something of his own, proceeds:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“To vary the
form of the theorem; the reason why capital yields a profit, is because food,
clothing, materials and tools, last longer than the time which was required to
produce them.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He here confounds the duration of labour-time
with the duration of its products. According to this view, a baker whose
product lasts only a day, could never extract from his workpeople the same
profit, as a machine maker whose products endure for 20 years and more. Of
course it is very true, that if a bird’s nest did not last longer than the time
it takes in building, birds would have to do without nests. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre12">This fundamental
truth once established, Mill establishes his own superiority over the
mercantilists.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“We thus
see,” he proceeds, “that profit arises, not from the incident of exchange, but
from the productive power of labour; and the general profit of the country is
always what the productive power of labour makes it, whether any exchange takes
place or not. If there were no division of employments, there would be no
buying or selling, but there would still be profit.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For Mill then, exchange, buying and selling,
those general conditions of capitalist production, are but an incident, and
there would always be profits even without the purchase and sale of
labour-power!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“If,” he continues, “the labourers of the
country collectively produce twenty per cent more than their wages, profits
will be twenty per cent, whatever prices may or may not be.” This is, on the
one hand, a rare bit of tautology; for if labourers produce a surplus-value of
20% for the capitalist, his profit will be to the total wages of the labourers
as 20:100. On the other hand, it is absolutely false to say that “profits will
be 20%.” They will always be less, because they are calculated upon the <i class="calibre4">sum
total</i> of the capital advanced. If, for example, the capitalist have
advanced £500, of which £4OO is laid out in means of production and £100 in
wages, and if the rate of surplus-value be 20%, the rate of profit will be
20:500, <i class="calibre4">i.e.</i>, 4% and not 20%. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Then follows a splendid example of Mill’s method
of handling the different historical forms of social production.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“I assume,
throughout, the state of things which, where the labourers and capitalists are
separate classes, prevails, with few exceptions, universally; namely, that the
capitalist advances the whole expenses, including the entire remuneration of
the labourer.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Strange optical illusion to see everywhere a
state of things which as yet exists only exceptionally on our earth.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn745" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref745"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a> But let us finish – Mill is willing to
concede,</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“that he
should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity.” On the contrary: “the
labourer might wait, until the production is complete, for all that part of his
wages which exceeds mere necessaries: and even for the whole, if he has funds
in hand sufficient for his temporary support. But in the latter case, the
labourer is to that extent really a capitalist in the concern, by supplying a
portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mill might have gone further and have added,
that the labourer who advances to himself not only the necessaries of life but
also the means of production, is in reality nothing but his own wage-labourer.
He might also have said that the American peasant proprietor is but a serf who
does enforced labour for himself instead of for his lord. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After thus proving clearly, that even if
capitalist production had no existence, still it would always exist, Mill is
consistent enough to show, on the contrary, that it has no existence, even when
it does exist.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“And even in
the former case” (when the workman is a wage labourer to whom the capitalist
advances all the necessaries of life, he the labourer), “may be looked upon in
the same light,” (i.e., as a capitalist), “since, contributing his labour at
less than the market-price, (!) he may be regarded as lending the difference
(?) to his employer and receiving it back with interest, &amp;c.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn746" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref746"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In reality, the labourer advances his labour
gratuitously to the capitalist during, say one week, in order to receive the
market price at the end of the week, &amp;c., and it is this which, according
to Mill, transforms him into a capitalist. On the level plain, simple mounds
look like hills; and the imbecile flatness of the present bourgeoisie is to be
measured by the altitude of its great intellects. </span></p>
