of Labour-Power and in Surplus-Value</span></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The value
of labour-power is determined by the value of the necessaries of life
habitually required by the average labourer. The quantity of these necessaries
is known at any given epoch of a given society, and can therefore be treated as
a constant magnitude. What changes, is the value of this quantity. There are,
besides, two other factors that enter into the determination of the value of
labour-power. One, the expenses of developing that power, which expenses vary
with the mode of production; the other, its natural diversity, the difference
between the labour-power of men and women, of children and adults. The
employment of these different sorts of labour-power, an employment which is, in
its turn, made necessary by the mode of production, makes a great difference in
the cost of maintaining the family of the labourer, and in the value of the
labour-power of the adult male. Both these factors, however, are excluded in
the following investigation.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn747" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref747"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="assumptions"><span lang="EN-GB">I assume (1) that commodities are sold at their value; (2) that the
price of labour-power rises occasionally above its value, but never sinks below
it. </span></a></p>

<span></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On this
assumption we have seen that the relative magnitudes of surplus-value and of
price of labour-power are determined by three circumstances; (1) the length of
the working day, or the extensive magnitude of labour; (2) the normal intensity
of labour, its intensive magnitude, whereby a given quantity of labour is
expended in a given time; (3) the productiveness of labour, whereby the same
quantum of labour yields, in a given time, a greater or less quantum of
product, dependent on the degree of development in the conditions of
production. Very different combinations are clearly possible, according as one
of the three factors is constant and two variable, or two constant and one
variable, or lastly, all three simultaneously variable. And the number of these
combinations is augmented by the fact that, when these factors simultaneously
vary, the amount and direction of their respective variations may differ. In
what follows the chief combinations alone are considered. </span></p>

<h3 class="calibre23"><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="_Toc273516451"></a><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="__RefHeading__778_1418669237"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre20"></span><span class="calibre20"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">Section 1: Length of the Working day and
Intensity of Labour Constant. Productiveness of Labour Variable</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On these
assumptions the value of labour-power, and the magnitude of surplus-value, are
determined by three laws. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">(1.)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> A working day of given length
always creates the same amount of value, no matter how the productiveness of
labour, and, with it, the mass of the product, and the price of each single
commodity produced, may vary. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If the
value created by a working day of 12 hours be, say, six shillings, then,
although the mass of the articles produced varies with the productiveness of
labour, the only result is that the value represented by six shillings is
spread over a greater or less number of articles. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">(2.)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> Surplus-value and the value of
labour-power vary in opposite directions. A variation in the productiveness of
labour, its increase or diminution, causes a variation in the opposite
direction in the value of labour-power, and in the same direction in surplus-value.
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The value
created by a working day of 12 hours is a constant quantity, say, six
shillings. This constant quantity is the sum of the surplus-value plus the
value of the labour-power, which latter value the labourer replaces by an
equivalent. It is self-evident, that if a constant quantity consists of two
parts, neither of them can increase without the other diminishing. Let the two
parts at starting be equal; 3 shillings value of labour-power, 3 shillings surplus-value.
Then the value of the labour-power cannot rise from three shillings to four,
without the surplus-value falling from three shillings to two; and the surplus-value
cannot rise from three shillings to four, without the value of labour-power
falling from three shillings to two. Under these circumstances, therefore, no
change can take place in the absolute magnitude, either of the surplus-value,
or of the value of labour-power, without a simultaneous change in their
relative magnitudes, <em class="calibre4">i.e.</em>, relatively to each other. It is impossible
for them to rise or fall simultaneously. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Further,
the value of labour-power cannot fall, and consequently surplus-value cannot
rise, without a rise in the productiveness of labour. For instance, in the
above case, the value of the labour-power cannot sink from three shillings to
two, unless an increase in the productiveness of labour makes it possible to
produce in 4 hours the same quantity of necessaries as previously required 6
hours to produce. On the other hand, the value of the labour-power cannot rise
from three shillings to four, without a decrease in the productiveness of
labour, whereby eight hours become requisite to produce the same quantity of necessaries,
for the production of which six hours previously sufficed. It follows from
this, that an increase in the productiveness of labour causes a fall in the
value of labour-power and a consequent rise in surplus-value, while, on the
other hand, a decrease in such productiveness causes a rise in the value of
labour-power, and a fall in surplus-value. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In
formulating this law, Ricardo overlooked one circumstance; although a change in
the magnitude of the surplus-value or surplus labour causes a change in the
opposite direction in the magnitude of the value of labour-power, or in the
quantity of necessary labour, it by no means follows that they vary in the same
proportion. They do increase or diminish by the same quantity. But their
proportional increase or diminution depends on their original magnitudes before
the change in the productiveness of labour took place. If the value of the
labour-power be 4 shillings, or the necessary labour time 8 hours, and the surplus-value
be 2 shillings, or the surplus labour 4 hours, and if, in consequence of an
increase in the productiveness of labour, the value of the labour-power fall to
3 shillings, or the necessary labour to 6 hours, the surplus-value will rise to
3 shillings, or the surplus labour to 6 hours. The same quantity, 1 shilling or
2 hours, is added in one case and subtracted in the other. But the proportional
change of magnitude is different in each case. While the value of the
labour-power falls from 4 shillings to 3, <em class="calibre4">i.e.</em>, by 1/4 or 25%, the surplus-value
rises from 2 shillings to 3, <em class="calibre4">i.e.</em>, by 1/2 or 50%. It therefore follows
that the proportional increase or diminution in surplus-value, consequent on a
given change in the productiveness of labour, depends on the original magnitude
of that portion of the working day which embodies itself in surplus-value; the
smaller that portion, the greater is the proportional change; the greater that
portion, the less is the proportional change. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">(3.)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> Increase or diminution in surplus-value
is always consequent on, and never the cause of, the corresponding diminution
or increase in the value of labour-power.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn748" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref748"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Since the
working day is constant in magnitude, and is represented by a value of constant
magnitude, since, to every variation in the magnitude of surplus-value, there
corresponds an inverse variation in the value of labour-power, and since the
value of labour-power cannot change, except in consequence of a change in the
productiveness of labour, it clearly follows, under these conditions, that
every change of magnitude in surplus-value arises from an inverse change of
magnitude in the value of labour-power. If, then, as we have already seen,
there can be no change of absolute magnitude in the value of labour-power, and
in surplus-value, unaccompanied by a change in their relative magnitudes, so
now it follows that no change in their relative magnitudes is possible, without
a previous change in the absolute magnitude of the value of labour-power. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">According
to the third law, a change in the magnitude of surplus-value, presupposes a
movement in the value of labour-power, which movement is brought about by a
variation in the productiveness of labour. The limit of this change is given by
the altered value of labour-power. Nevertheless, even when circumstances allow
the law to operate, subsidiary movements may occur. For example: if in
consequence of the increased productiveness of labour, the value of
labour-power falls from 4 shillings to 3, or the necessary labour time from 8
hours to 6, the price of labour-power may possibly not fall below 3s. 8d., 3s.
6d., or 3s. 2d., and the surplus-value consequently not rise above 3s. 4d., 3s.
6d., or 3s. 10d. The amount of this fall, the lowest limit of which is 3
shillings (the new value of labour-power), depends on the relative weight,
which the pressure of capital on the one side, and the resistance of the
labourer on the other, throws into the scale. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The value
of labour-power is determined by the value of a given quantity of necessaries.
It is the value and not the mass of these necessaries that varies with the
productiveness of labour. It is, however, possible that, owing to an increase
of productiveness, both the labourer and the capitalist may simultaneously be
able to appropriate a greater quantity of these necessaries, without any change
in the price of labour-power or in surplus-value. If the value of labour-power
be 3 shillings, and the necessary labour time amount to 6 hours, if the surplus-value
likewise be 3 shillings, and the surplus labour 6 hours, then if the productiveness
of labour were doubled without altering the ratio of necessary labour to
surplus labour, there would be no change of magnitude in surplus-value and
price of labour-power. The only result would be that each of them would
represent twice as many use-values as before; these use-values being twice as
cheap as before. Although labour-power would be unchanged in price, it would be
above its value. If, however, the price of labour-power had fallen, not to 1s.
6d., the lowest possible point consistent with its new value, but to 2s. 10d.
or 2s. 6d., still this lower price would represent an increased mass of
necessaries. In this way it is possible with an increasing productiveness of
labour, for the price of labour-power to keep on falling, and yet this fall to
be accompanied by a constant growth in the mass of the labourer's means of
subsistence. But even in such case, the fall in the value of labour-power would
cause a corresponding rise of surplus-value, and thus the abyss between the
labourer's position and that of the capitalist would keep widening.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn749" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref749"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Ricardo was
the first who accurately formulated the three laws we have above stated. But he
falls into the following errors: (1) he looks upon the special conditions under
which these laws hold good as the general and sole conditions of capitalist
production. He knows no change, either in the length of the working day, or in
the intensity of labour; consequently with him there can be only one variable
factor, viz., the productiveness of labour; (2), and this error vitiates his
analysis much more than (1), he has not, any more than have the other
economists, investigated surplus-value as such, <em class="calibre4">i.e.</em>, independently of
its particular forms, such as profit, rent, &amp;c. He therefore confounds
together the laws of the rate of surplus-value and the laws of the rate of
profit. The rate of profit is, as we have already said, the ratio of the surplus-value
to the total capital advanced; the rate of surplus-value is the ratio of the surplus-value
to the variable part of that capital. Assume that a capital C of £500 is made
up of raw material, instruments of labour, &amp;c. (c) to the amount of £400;
and of wages (v) to the amount of £100; and further, that the surplus-value (s)
= £100. Then we have rate of surplus-value s/v = £100/£100 = 100%. But the rate
of profit s/c = £100/£500 = 20%. It is, besides, obvious that the rate of
profit may depend on circumstances that in no way affect the rate of surplus-value.
I shall show in Book III. that, with a given rate of surplus-value, we may have
any number of rates of profit, and that various rates of surplus-value may,
under given conditions, express themselves in a single rate of profit. </span></p>

<h3 class="calibre23"><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="_Toc273516452"></a><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="__RefHeading__780_1418669237"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre20"></span><span class="calibre20"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">Section 2: Working day Constant. Productiveness
of Labour Constant. Intensity of Labour Variable</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Increased
intensity of labour means increased expenditure of labour in a given time.
Hence a working day of more intense labour is embodied in more products than is
one of less intense labour, the length of each day being the same. Increased
productiveness of labour also, it is true, will supply more products in a given
working day. But in this latter case, the value of each single product falls,
for it costs less labour than before; in the former case, that value remains
unchanged, for each article costs the same labour as before. Here we have an
increase in the number of products, unaccompanied by a fall in their individual
prices: as their number increases, so does the sum of their prices. But in the
case of increased productiveness, a given value is spread over a greater mass
of products. Hence the length of the working day being constant, a day's labour
of increased intensity will be incorporated in an increased value, and, the
value of money remaining unchanged, in more money. The value created varies
with the extent to which the intensity of labour deviates from its normal
intensity in the society. A given working day, therefore, no longer creates a
constant, but a variable value; in a day of 12 hours of ordinary intensity, the
value created is, say 6 shillings, but with increased intensity, the value
created may be 7, 8, or more shillings. It is clear that, if the value created
by a day's labour increases from, say, 6 to 8 shillings then the two parts into
which this value is divided, viz., price of labour-power and surplus-value, may
both of them increase simultaneously, and either equally or unequally. They may
both simultaneously increase from 3 shillings to 4. Here, the rise in the price
of labour-power does not necessarily imply that the price has risen above the
value of labour-power. On the contrary, the rise in price may be accompanied by
a fall in value. This occurs whenever the rise in the price of labour-power
does not compensate for its increased wear and tear. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We know
that, with transitory exceptions, a change in the productiveness of labour does
not cause any change in the value of labour-power, nor consequently in the
magnitude of surplus-value, unless the products of the industries affected are
articles habitually consumed by the labourers. In the present case this
condition no longer applies. For when the variation is either in the duration
or in the intensity of labour, there is always a corresponding change in the
magnitude of the value created, independently of the nature of the article in which
that value is embodied. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If the
intensity of labour were to increase simultaneously and equally in every branch
of industry, then the new and higher degree of intensity would become the
normal degree for the society, and would therefore cease to be taken account
of. But still, even then, the intensity of labour would be different in
different countries, and would modify the international application of the law
of value. The more intense working day of one nation would be represented by a
greater sum of money than would the less intense day of another nation.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn750" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref750"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

</span>Productiveness and Intensity of Labour Constant. Length of the Working
day Variable</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The working
day may vary in two ways. It may be made either longer or shorter. From our
present data, and within the limits of the assumptions made above we obtain the
following laws:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">(1.)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> The working day creates a greater
or less amount of value in proportion to its length – thus, a variable and not
a constant quantity of value.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">(2.)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> Every change in the relation
between the magnitudes of surplus-value and of the value of labour-power arises
from a change in the absolute magnitude of the surplus labour, and consequently
of the surplus-value.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">(3.)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> The absolute value of labour-power
can change only in consequence of the reaction exercised by the prolongation of
surplus labour upon the wear and tear of labour-power. Every change in this
absolute value is therefore the effect, but never the cause, of a change in the
magnitude of surplus-value.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We begin
with the case in which the working day is shortened.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">(1.)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> A shortening of the working day
under the conditions given above, leaves the value of labour-power, and with
it, the necessary labour time, unaltered. It reduces the surplus labour and surplus-value.
Along with the absolute magnitude of the latter, its relative magnitude also
falls, <em class="calibre4">i.e., </em>its magnitude relatively to the value of labour-power
whose magnitude remains unaltered. Only by lowering the price of labour-power
below its value could the capitalist save himself harmless. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">All the
usual arguments against the shortening of the working day, assume that it takes
place under the conditions we have here supposed to exist; but in reality the
very contrary is the case: a change in the productiveness and intensity of
labour either precedes, or immediately follows, a shortening of the working
day.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn751" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref751"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a><em class="calibre4"></em></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">(2.)</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> Lengthening of the working day. Let
the necessary labour time be 6 hours, or the value of labour-power 3 shillings;
also let the surplus labour be 6 hours or the surplus-value 3 shillings. The
whole working day then amounts to 12 hours and is embodied in a value of 6
shillings. If, now, the working day be lengthened by 2 hours and the price of
labour-power remain unaltered, the surplus-value increases both absolutely and
relatively. Although there is no absolute change in the value of labour-power,
it suffers a relative fall. Under the conditions assumed in 1. there could not
be a change of relative magnitude in the value of labour-power without a change
in its absolute magnitude. Here, on the contrary, the change of relative
magnitude in the value of labour-power is the result of the change of absolute
magnitude in surplus-value.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Since the
value in which a day's labour is embodied, increases with the length of that day,
it is evident that the surplus-value and the price of labour-power may
simultaneously increase, either by equal or unequal quantities. This
simultaneous increase is therefore possible in two cases, one, the actual
lengthening of the working day, the other, an increase in the intensity of
labour unaccompanied by such lengthening. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When the
working day is prolonged, the price of labour-power may fall below its value,
although that price be nominally unchanged or even rise. The value of a day's
labour-power is, as will be remembered, estimated from its normal average
duration, or from the normal duration of life among the labourers, and from
corresponding normal transformations of organised bodily matter into motion,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn752" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref752"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> in conformity with the nature of man. Up
to a certain point, the increased wear and tear of labour-power, inseparable
from a lengthened working day, may be compensated by higher wages. But beyond
this point the wear and tear increases in geometrical progression, and every
condition suitable for the normal reproduction and functioning of labour-power
is suppressed. The price of labour-power and the degree of its exploitation
cease to be commensurable quantities.</span></p>

Duration, Productiveness, and Intensity of Labour</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is
obvious that a large number of combinations are here possible. Any two of the
factors may vary and the third remain constant, or all three may vary at once.
They may vary either in the same or in different degrees, in the same or in
opposite directions, with the result that the variations counteract one
another, either wholly or in part. Nevertheless the analysis of every possible
case is easy in view of the results given in I., II., and III. The effect of
every possible combination may be found by treating each factor in turn as
variable, and the other two constant for the time being. We shall, therefore,
notice, and that briefly, but two important cases.</span></p>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">A. Diminishing Productiveness of Labour with a
Simultaneous Lengthening of the Working day</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In speaking
of diminishing productiveness of labour, we here refer to diminution in those
industries whose products determine the value of labour-power; such a
diminution, for example, as results from decreasing fertility of the soil, and
from the corresponding dearness of its products. Take the working day at 12
hours and the value created by it at 6 shillings, of which one half replaces
the value of the labour-power, the other forms the surplus-value. Suppose, in
consequence of the increased dearness of the products of the soil, that the
value of labour-power rises from 3 shillings to 4, and therefore the necessary
labour time from 6 hours to 8. If there be no change in the length of the
working day, the surplus labour would fall from 6 hours to 4, the surplus-value
from 3 shillings to 2. If the day be lengthened by 2 hours, <em class="calibre4">i.e.</em>, from
12 hours to 14, the surplus labour remains at 6 hours, the surplus-value at 3
shillings<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_052.htm#_ftn2" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ftnref2"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">*</span></a>, but the surplus-value decreases compared
with the value of labour-power, as measured by the necessary labour time. If
the day be lengthened by 4 hours, viz., from 12 hours to 16, the proportional
magnitudes of surplus-value and value of labour-power, of surplus labour and
necessary labour, continue unchanged, but the absolute magnitude of surplus-value
rises from 3 shillings to 4, that of the surplus labour from 6 hours to 8, an
increment of 33 1/3%. Therefore, with diminishing productiveness of labour and
a simultaneous lengthening of the working day, the absolute magnitude of surplus-value
may continue unaltered, at the same time that its relative magnitude
diminishes; its relative magnitude may continue unchanged, at the same time
that its absolute magnitude increases; and, provided the lengthening of the day
be sufficient, both may increase. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
period between 1799 and 1815 the increasing price of provisions led in England
to a nominal rise in wages, although the real wages, expressed in the
necessaries of life, fell. From this fact West and Ricardo drew the conclusion,
that the diminution in the productiveness of agricultural labour had brought
about a fall in the rate of surplus-value, and they made this assumption of a
fact that existed only in their imaginations, the starting-point of important
investigations into the relative magnitudes of wages, profits, and rent. But,
as a matter of fact, surplus-value had at that time, thanks to the increased
intensity of labour, and to the prolongation of the working day, increased both
in absolute and relative magnitude. This was the period in which the right to
prolong the hours of labour to an outrageous extent was established; <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn753" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref753"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a> the period that was especially
characterised by an accelerated accumulation of capital here, by pauperism
there.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn754" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref754"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a> </span></p>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">B. Increasing Intensity and Productiveness of Labour
with Simultaneous Shortening of the Working day</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Increased
productiveness and greater intensity of labour, both have a like effect. They
both augment the mass of articles produced in a given time. Both, therefore,
shorten that portion of the working day which the labourer needs to produce his
means of subsistence or their equivalent. The minimum length of the working day
is fixed by this necessary but contractile portion of it. If the whole working
day were to shrink to the length of this portion, surplus labour would vanish,
a consummation utterly impossible under the régime of capital. Only by
suppressing the capitalist form of production could the length of the working
day be reduced to the necessary labour time. But, even in that case, the latter
would extend its limits. On the one hand, because the notion of “means of
subsistence” would considerably expand, and the labourer would lay claim to an
altogether different standard of life. On the other hand, because a part of
what is now surplus labour, would then count as necessary labour; I mean the
labour of forming a fund for reserve and accumulation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The more
the productiveness of labour increases, the more can the working day be
shortened; and the more the working day is shortened, the more can the intensity
of labour increase. From a social point of view, the productiveness increases
in the same ratio as the economy of labour, which, in its turn, includes not
only economy of the means of production, but also the avoidance of all useless
labour. The capitalist mode of production, while on the one hand, enforcing
economy in each individual business, on the other hand, begets, by its
anarchical system of competition, the most outrageous squandering of
labour-power and of the social means of production, not to mention the creation
of a vast number of employments, at present indispensable, but in themselves
superfluous.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
intensity and productiveness of labour being given, the time which society is
bound to devote to material production is shorter, and as a consequence, the
time at its disposal for the free development, intellectual and social, of the
individual is greater, in proportion as the work is more and more evenly
divided among all the able-bodied members of society, and as a particular class
is more and more deprived of the power to shift the natural burden of labour
from its own shoulders to those of another layer of society. In this direction,
the shortening of the working day finds at last a limit in the generalisation
of labour. In capitalist society spare time is acquired for one class by
converting the whole life-time of the masses into labour time. </span></p>
