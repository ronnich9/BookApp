(and Respective Price) of Labour-Power into Wages</span></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the
surface of bourgeois society the wage of the labourer appears as the price of
labour, a certain quantity of money that is paid for a certain quantity of
labour. Thus people speak of the value of labour and call its expression in
money its necessary or natural price. On the other hand they speak of the
market-prices of labour, i.e., prices oscillating above or below its natural
price. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But what is
the value of a commodity? The objective form of the social labour expended in
its production. And how do we measure the quantity of this value? By the
quantity of the labour contained in it. How then is the value, e.g., of a 12
hour working-day to be determined? By the 12 working-hours contained in a
working day of 12 hours, which is an absurd tautology.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn759" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref759"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In order to
be sold as a commodity in the market, labour must at all events exist before it
is sold. But, could the labourer give it an independent objective existence, he
would sell a commodity and not labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn760" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref760"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Apart from
these contradictions, a direct exchange of money, i.e., of realized labour,
with living labour would either do away with the law of value which only begins
to develop itself freely on the basis of capitalist production, or do away with
capitalist production itself, which rests directly on wage-labour. The working
day of 12 hours embodies itself, e.g., in a money-value of 6s. Either
equivalents are exchanged, and then the labourer receives 6s, for 12 hours’
labour; the price of his labour would be equal to the price of his product. In
this case he produces no surplus-value for the buyer of his labour, the 6s. are
not transformed into capital, the basis of capitalist production vanishes. But
it is on this very basis that he sells his labour and that his labour is
wage-labour. Or else he receives for 12 hours’ labour less than 6s., i.e., less
than 12 hours’ labour. Twelve hours’ labour are exchanged against 10, 6,
&amp;c., hours’ labour. This equalisation of unequal quantities not merely does
away with the determination of value. Such a self-destructive contradiction
cannot be in any way even enunciated or formulated as a law.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn761" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref761"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is of no
avail to deduce the exchange of more labour against less, from their difference
of form, the one being realized, the other living.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn762" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref762"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> This is the more absurd as the value of a
commodity is determined not by the quantity of labour actually realized in it,
but by the quantity of living labour necessary for its production. A commodity
represents, say, 6 working-hours. If an invention is made by which it can be
produced in 3 hours, the value, even of the commodity already produced, falls
by half. It represents now 3 hours of social labour instead of the 6 formerly
necessary. It is the quantity of labour required for its production, not the
realized form of that labour, by which the amount of the value of a commodity
is determined. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">That which
comes directly face to face with the possessor of money on the market, is in
fact not labour, but the labourer. What the latter sells is his labour-power.
As soon as his labour actually begins, it has already ceased to belong to him;
it can therefore no longer be sold by him. Labour is the substance, and the
immanent measure of value, but has itself no value.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn763" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref763"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
expression “value of labour,” the idea of value is not only completely
obliterated, but actually reversed. It is an expression as imaginary as the
value of the earth. These imaginary expressions, arise, however, from the
relations of production themselves. They are categories for the phenomenal
forms of essential relations. That in their appearance things often represent
themselves in inverted form is pretty well known in every science except
Political Economy.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn764" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref764"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Classical
Political Economy borrowed from every-day life the category “price of labour”
without further criticism, and then simply asked the question, how is this
price determined? It soon recognized that the change in the relations of demand
and supply explained in regard to the price of labour, as of all other
commodities, nothing except its changes i.e., the oscillations of the
market-price above or below a certain mean. If demand and supply balance, the
oscillation of prices ceases, all other conditions remaining the same. But then
demand and supply also cease to explain anything. The price of labour, at the
moment when demand and supply are in equilibrium, is its natural price,
determined independently of the relation of demand and supply. And how this
price is determined is just the question. Or a larger period of oscillations in
the market-price is taken, e.g., a year, and they are found to cancel one the
other, leaving a mean average quantity, a relatively constant magnitude. This
had naturally to be determined otherwise than by its own compensating
variations. This price which always finally predominates over the accidental
market-prices of labour and regulates them, this “necessary price”
(Physiocrats) or “natural price” of labour (Adam Smith) can, as with all other
commodities, be nothing else than its value expressed in money. In this way
Political Economy expected to penetrate athwart the accidental prices of
labour, to the value of labour. As with other commodities, this value was
determined by the cost of production. But what is the cost of production -
of the labourer, i.e., the cost of producing or reproducing the labourer
himself? This question unconsciously substituted itself in Political Economy
for the original one; for the search after the cost of production of labour as
such turned in a circle and never left the spot. What economists therefore call
value of labour, is in fact the value of labour-power, as it exists in the
personality of the labourer, which is as different from its function, labour,
as a machine is from the work it performs. Occupied with the difference between
the market-price of labour and its so-called value, with the relation of this
value to the rate of profit, and to the values of the commodities produced by
means of labour, &amp;c., they never discovered that the course of the analysis
had led not only from the market-prices of labour to its presumed value, but
had led to the resolution of this value of labour itself into the value of
labour-power. Classical economy never arrived at a consciousness of the results
of its own analysis; it accepted uncritically the categories “value of labour,”
“natural price of labour,” &amp;c., as final and as adequate expressions for
the value-relation under consideration, and was thus led, as will be seen
later, into inextricable confusion and contradiction, while it offered to the
vulgar economists a secure basis of operations for their shallowness, which on
principle worships appearances only. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us next
see how value (and price) of labour-power, present themselves in this
transformed condition as wages. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We know
that the daily value of labour-power is calculated upon a certain length of the
labourer’s life, to which, again, corresponds a certain length of working day.
Assume the habitual working day as 12 hours, the daily value of labour-power as
3s., the expression in money of a value that embodies 6 hours of labour. If the
labourer receives 3s., then he receives the value of his labour-power
functioning through 12 hours. If, now, this value of a day’s labour-power is
expressed as the value of a day’s labour itself, we have the formula: Twelve
hours’ labour has a value of 3s. The value of labour-power thus determines the
value of labour, or, expressed in money, its necessary price. If, on the other
hand, the price of labour-power differs from its value, in like manner the
price of labour differs from its so-called value. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As the
value of labour is only an irrational expression for the value of labour-power,
it follows, of course, that the value of labour must always be less than the
value it produces, for the capitalist always makes labour-power work longer
than is necessary for the reproduction of its own value. In the above example,
the value of the labour-power that functions through 12 hours is 3s., a value
for the reproduction of which 6 hours are required. The value which the
labour-power produces is, on the other hand, 6s., because it, in fact,
functions during 12 hours, and the value it produces depends, not on its own
value, but on the length of time it is in action. Thus, we have a result absurd
at first sight that labour which creates a value of 6s. possesses a value of
3s.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn765" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref765"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We see,
further: The value of 3s. by which a part only of the working day – i.e., 6
hours’ labour-is paid for, appears as the value or price of the whole working
day of 12 hours, which thus includes 6 hours unpaid for. The wage form thus
extinguishes every trace of the division of the working day into necessary
labour and surplus labour, into paid and unpaid labour. All labour appears as
paid labour. In the corvée, the labour of the worker for himself, and his
compulsory labour for his lord, differ in space and time in the clearest possible
way. In slave labour, even that part of the working day in which the slave is
only replacing the value of his own means of existence, in which, therefore, in
fact, he works for himself alone, appears as labour for his master. All the
slave’s labour appears as unpaid labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn766" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref766"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a>
In wage labour, on the contrary, even surplus labour, or unpaid labour, appears
as paid. There the property-relation conceals the labour of the slave for
himself; here the money-relation conceals the unrequited labour of the wage labourer.
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hence, we
may understand the decisive importance of the transformation of value and price
of labour-power into the form of wages, or into the value and price of labour
itself. This phenomenal form, which makes the actual relation invisible, and, indeed,
shows the direct opposite of that relation, forms the basis of all the
juridical notions of both labourer and capitalist, of all the mystifications of
the capitalistic mode of production, of all its illusions as to liberty, of all
the apologetic shifts of the vulgar economists. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If history
took a long time to get at the bottom of the mystery of wages, nothing, on the
other hand, is more easy to understand than the necessity, the raison d’etre,
of this phenomenon. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
exchange between capital and labour at first presents itself to the mind in the
same guise as the buying and selling of all other commodities. The buyer gives
a certain sum of money, the seller an article of a nature different from money.
The jurist’s consciousness recognizes in this, at most, a material difference,
expressed in the juridically equivalent formula: “Do ut des, do ut facias,
facio ut des, facio ut facias.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn767" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref767"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Furthermore,
exchange-value and use-value, being intrinsically incommensurable magnitudes,
the expressions “value of labour,” “price of labour,” do not seem more
irrational than the expressions “value of cotton,” “price of cotton.” Moreover,
the labourer is paid after he has given his labour. In its function of means of
payment, money realizes subsequently the value or price of the article supplied
– i.e., in this particular case, the value or price of the labour supplied.
Finally, the use-value supplied by the labourer to the capitalist is not, in
fact, his labour-power, but its function, some definite useful labour, the work
of tailoring, shoemaking, spinning, &amp;c. That this same labour is, on the
other hand, the universal value-creating element, and thus possesses a property
by which it differs from all other commodities, is beyond the cognizance of the
ordinary mind. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us put
ourselves in the place of the labourer who receives for 12 hours’ labour, say
the value produced by 6 hours’ labour, say 3s. For him, in fact, his 12 hours’
labour is the means of buying the 3s. The value of his labour-power may vary,
with the value of his usual means of subsistence, from 3 to 4 shillings, or
from 3 to 2 shillings; or, if the value of his labour-power remains constant,
its price may, in consequence of changing relations of demand and supply, rise
to 4s. or fall to 2s. He always gives 12 hours of labour. Every change in the
amount of the equivalent that he receives appears to him, therefore,
necessarily as a change in the value or price of his 12 hours’ work. This
circumstance misled Adam Smith, who treated the working day as a constant
quantity,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn768" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref768"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a> to the assertion that the
value of labour is constant, although the value of the means of subsistence may
vary, and the same working day, therefore, may represent itself in more or less
money for the labourer. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us
consider, on the other hand, the capitalist. He wishes to receive as much
labour as possible for as little money as possible. Practically, therefore, the
only thing that interests him is the difference between the price of
labour-power and the value which its function creates. But, then, he tries to
buy all commodities as cheaply as possible, and always accounts for his profit
by simple cheating, by buying under, and selling over the value. Hence, he
never comes to see that, if such a thing as the value of labour really existed,
and he really paid this value, no capital would exist, his money would not be
turned into capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Moreover,
the actual movement of wages presents phenomena which seem to prove that not
the value of labour-power is paid, but the value of its function, of labour
itself. We may reduce these phenomena to two great classes: 1.) Change of wages
with the changing length of the working day. One might as well conclude that
not the value of a machine is paid, but that of its working, because it costs
more to hire a machine for a week than for a day. 2.) The individual difference
in the wages of different labourers who do the same kind of work. We find this
individual difference, but are not deceived by it, in the system of slavery,
where, frankly and openly, without any circumlocution, labour-power itself is
sold. Only, in the slave system, the advantage of a labour-power above the
average, and the disadvantage of a labour-power below the average, affects the
slave-owner; in the wage-labour system, it affects the labourer himself,
because his labour-power is, in the one case, sold by himself, in the other, by
a third person. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For the
rest, in respect to the phenomenal form, “value and price of labour,” or
“wages,” as contrasted with the essential relation manifested therein, viz.,
the value and price of labour-power, the same difference holds that holds in
respect to all phenomena and their hidden substratum. The former appear
directly and spontaneously as current modes of thought; the latter must first
be discovered by science. Classical Political Economy nearly touches the true
relation of things, without, however, consciously formulating it. This it
cannot, so long as it sticks in its bourgeois skin. </span></p>
