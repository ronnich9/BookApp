<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre12">The confidence that
trusts in this appearance ought to receive a first severe shock from the fact
that both forms of wages exist side by side, simultaneously, in the same branches
of industry; e.g.,</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“the
compositors of London, as a general rule, work by the piece, time-work being
the exception, while those in the country work by the day, the exception being
work by the piece. The shipwrights of the port of London work by the job or
piece, while those of all other parts work by the day.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn785" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref785"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the same saddlery shops of London, often for
the same work, piece wages are paid to the French, time-wages to the English.
In the regular factories in which throughout piece wages predominate,
particular kinds of work are unsuitable to this form of wage, and are therefore
paid by time.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn786" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref786"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a> But it is, moreover,
self-evident that the difference of form in the payment of wages alters in no
way their essential nature, although the one form may be more favorable to the
development of capitalist production than the other. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let the ordinary working day contain 12 hours of
which 6 are paid, 6 unpaid. Let its value-product be 6 shillings, that of one
hour’s labour therefore 6d. Let us suppose that, as the result of experience, a
labourer who works with the average amount of intensity and skill, who,
therefore, gives in fact only the time socially necessary to the production of
an article, supplies in 12 hours 24 pieces, either distinct products or measurable
parts of a continuous whole. Then the value of these 24 pieces, after.
subtraction of the portion of constant capital contained in them, is 6
shillings, and the value of a single piece 3d. The labourer receives 1 ½d. per
piece, and thus earns in 12 hours 3 shillings. Just as, with time-wages, it
does not matter whether we assume that the labourer works 6 hours for himself
and 6 hours for the capitalist, or half of every hour for himself, and the
other half for the capitalist, so here it does not matter whether we say that
each individual piece is half paid, and half unpaid for, or that the price of
12 pieces is the equivalent only of the value of the labour-power, whilst in
the other 12 pieces surplus-value is incorporated. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The form of piece wages is just as irrational as
that of time-wages. Whilst in our example two pieces of a commodity, after
subtraction of the value of the means of production consumed in them, are worth
6d. as being the product of one hour, the labourer receives for them a price of
3d. Piece wages do not, in fact, distinctly express any relation of value. It
is not, therefore, a question of measuring the value of the piece by the
working-time incorporated in it, but on the contrary, of measuring the
working-time the labourer has expended by the number of pieces he has produced.
In time-wages, the labour is measured by its immediate duration; in piece
wages, by the quantity of products in which the labour has embodied itself
during a given time.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn787" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref787"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> The price
of labour time itself is finally determined by the equation: value of a day’s
labour = daily value of labour-power. Piece-wage is, therefore, only a modified
form of time-wage. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us now consider a little more closely the
characteristic peculiarities of piece wages. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The quality of the labour is here controlled by
the work itself, which must be of average perfection if the piece-price is to
be paid in full. Piece wages become, from this point of view, the most fruitful
source of reductions of wages and capitalistic cheating. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">They furnish to the capitalist an exact measure
for the intensity of labour. Only the working-time which is embodied in a
quantum of commodities determined beforehand, and experimentally fixed, counts
as socially necessary working-time, and is paid as such. In the larger
workshops of the London tailors, therefore, a certain piece of work, a
waistcoat, e.g., is called an hour, or half an hour, the hour at 6d. By
practice it is known how much is the average product of one hour. With new
fashions, repairs, &amp;c., a contest arises between master and labourer as to
whether a particular piece of work is one hour, and so on, until here also
experience decides. Similarly in the London furniture workshops, &amp;c. If the
labourer does not possess the average capacity, if he cannot in consequence
supply a certain minimum of work per day, he is dismissed.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn788" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref788"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Since the quality and intensity of the work are
here controlled by the form of wage itself, superintendence of labour becomes
in great part superfluous. Piece wages therefore lay the foundation of the
modern “domestic labour,” described above, as well as of a hierarchically
organized system of exploitation and oppression. The latter has two fundamental
forms. On the one hand, piece wages facilitate the interposition of parasites between
the capitalist and the wage-labourer, the “sub-letting of labour.” The gain of
these middlemen comes entirely from the difference between the labour-price
which the capitalist pays, and the part of that price which they actually allow
to reach the labourer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn789" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref789"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> In
England this system is characteristically called the “sweating system.” On the
other hand, piece-wage allows the capitalist to make a contract for so much per
piece with the head labourer – in manufactures with the chief of some group, in
mines with the extractor of the coal, in the factory with the actual
machine-worker – at a price for which the head labourer himself undertakes the
enlisting and payment of his assistant work people. The exploitation of the
labourer by capital is here effected through the exploitation of the labourer
by the labourer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn790" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref790"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Given piece-wage, it is naturally the personal
interest of the labourer to strain his labour-power as intensely as possible;
this enables the capitalist to raise more easily the normal degree of intensity
of labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn791" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref791"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a> It is moreover now the
personal interest of the labourer to lengthen the working day, since with it
his daily or weekly wages rise.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn792" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref792"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a> This
gradually brings on a reaction like that already described in time-wages,
without reckoning that the prolongation of the working day, even if the piece
wage remains constant, includes of necessity a fall in the price of the labour.
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In time-wages, with few exceptions, the same
wage holds for the same kind of work, whilst in piece wages, though the price
of the working time is measured by a certain quantity of product, the day’s or
week’s wage will vary with the individual differences of the labourers, of whom
one supplies in a given time the minimum of product only, another the average,
a third more than the average. With regard to actual receipts there is,
therefore, great variety according to the different skill, strength, energy,
staying-power, &amp;c., of the individual labourers.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn793" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref793"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a> Of course this does not alter the general
relations between capital and wage-labour. First, the individual differences
balance one another in the workshop as a whole, which thus supplies in a given
working-time the average product, and the total wages paid will be the average
wages of that particular branch of industry. Second, the proportion between
wages and surplus-value remains unaltered, since the mass of surplus labour
supplied by each particular labourer corresponds with the wage received by him.
But the wider scope that piece-wage gives to individuality tends to develop on
the one hand that individuality, and with it the sense of liberty,
independence, and self-control of the labourers, and on the other, their
competition one with another. Piece-work has, therefore, a tendency, while
raising individual wages above the average, to lower this average itself. But
where a particular rate of piece-wage has for a long time been fixed by
tradition, and its lowering, therefore, presented especial difficulties, the
masters, in such exceptional cases, sometimes had recourse to its compulsory
transformation into time-wages. Hence, e.g., in 1860 a great strike among the
ribbon-weavers of Coventry.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn794" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref794"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a>
Piece-wage is finally one of the chief supports of the hour-system described in
the preceding chapter.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn795" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref795"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From what has been shown so far, it follows that
piece-wage is the form of wages most in harmony with the capitalist mode of
production. Although by no means new – it figures side by side with time-wages
officially in the French and English labour statutes of the 14th century – it
only conquers a larger field for action during the period of manufacture,
properly so-called. In the stormy youth of modern industry, especially from
1797 to 1815, it served as a lever for the lengthening of the working day, and
the lowering of wages. Very important materials for the fluctuation of wages
during that period are to be found in the Blue books: “Report and Evidence from
the Select Committee on Petitions respecting the Corn Laws” (Parliamentary
Session of 1813-14), and “Report from the Lords’ Committee, on the State of the
Growth, Commerce, and Consumption of Grain, and all Laws relating thereto”
(Session of 1814-15). Here we find documentary evidence of the constant
lowering of the price of labour from the beginning of the anti-Jacobin War. In
the weaving industry, e.g., piece wages had fallen so low that, in spite of the
very great lengthening of the working day, the daily wages were then lower than
before.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The real
earnings of the cotton weaver are now far less than they were; his superiority
over the common labourer, which at first was very great, has now almost
entirely ceased. Indeed... the difference in the wages of skillful and common
labour is far less now than at any former period.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn796" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref796"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">13</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">How little the increased intensity and extension
of labour through piece wages benefited the agricultural proletariat, the
following passage borrowed from a work on the side of the landlords and farmers
shows:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“By far the
greater part of agricultural operations is done by people who are hired for the
day or on piece-work. Their weekly wages are about 12s., and although it may be
assumed that a man earns on piece-work under the greater stimulus to labour,
1s. or perhaps 2s. more than on weekly wages, yet it is found, on calculating
his total income, that his loss of employment, during the year, outweighs this
gain...Further, it will generally be found that the wages of these men bear a
certain proportion to the price of the necessary means of subsistence, so that
a man with two children is able to bring up his family without recourse to
parish relief.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn797" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref797"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">14</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Malthus at that time remarked with reference to
the facts published by Parliament:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“I confess
that I see, with misgiving, the great extension of the practice of piece-wage.
Really hard work during 12 or 14 hours of the day, or for any longer time, is
too much for any human being.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn798" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref798"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">15</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the
workshops under the Factory Acts, piece wages become the general rule, because
capital can there only increase the efficacy of the working day by intensifying
labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn799" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref799"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">16</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">With the changing
productiveness of labour the same quantum of product represents a varying
working-time. Therefore, piece-wage also varies, for it is the money expression
of a determined working-time. In our example above, 24 pieces were produced in
12 hours, whilst the value of the product of the 12 hours was 6s., the daily
value of the labour-power 3s., the price of the labour-hour 3d., and the wage
for one piece ½d. In one piece half-an-hour’s labour was absorbed. If the same
working day now supplies, in consequence of the doubled productiveness of
labour, 48 pieces instead of 24, and all other circumstances remain unchanged,
then the piece-wage falls from 1 ½d. to 3/4d., as every piece now only
represents 1/4, instead of ½ of a working-hour. 24 by 1½d. = 3s., and in like
manner 48 by 3/4d. = 3s. In other words, piece-wage is lowered in the same
proportion as the number of the pieces produced in the same time rises,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn800" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref800"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">17</span></a> and, therefore, as the working time spent
on the same piece falls. This change in piece-wage, so far purely nominal,
leads to constant battles between capitalist and labour. Either because the
capitalist uses it as a pretext for actually lowering the price of labour, or
because increased productive power of labour is accompanied by an increased
intensity of the same. Or because the labourer takes seriously the appearance
of piece wages (viz., that his product is paid for, and not his labour-power)
and therefore revolts against a lowering of wages, unaccompanied by a lowering
in the selling price of the commodity.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The
operatives...carefully watch the price of the raw material and the price of
manufactured goods, and are thus enabled to form an accurate estimate of their
master’s profits.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn801" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref801"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">18</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The capitalist rightly knocks on the head such
pretensions as gross errors as to the nature of wage-labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn802" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref802"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">19</span></a> He cries out against this usurping
attempt to lay taxes on the advance of industry, and declares roundly that the
productiveness of labour does not concern the labourer at all.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn803" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref803"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">20</span></a> </span></p>
