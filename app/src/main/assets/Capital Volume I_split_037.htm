<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the 17th chapter we were occupied with the
manifold combinations which may bring about a change in magnitude of the value
of labour-power – this magnitude being considered either absolutely or
relatively, i.e., as compared with surplus-value; whilst on the other hand, the
quantum of the means of subsistence in which the price of labour is realized
might again undergo fluctuations independent of, or different from, the changes
of this price.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn804" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref804"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> As has been already said,
the simple translation of the value, or respectively of the price, of
labour-power into the exoteric form of wages transforms all these laws into
laws of the fluctuations of wages. That which appears in these fluctuations of
wages within a single country as a series of varying combinations, may appear
in different countries as contemporaneous difference of national wages. In the
comparison of the wages in different nations, we must therefore take into
account all the factors that determine changes in the amount of the value of labour-power;
the price and the extent of the prime necessaries of life as naturally and
historically developed, the cost of training the labourers, the part played by
the labour of women and children, the productiveness of labour, its extensive
and intensive magnitude. Even the most superficial comparison requires the
reduction first of the average day-wage for the same trades, in different
countries, to a uniform working day. After this reduction to the same terms of
the day-wages, time-wage must again be translated into piece-wage, as the
latter only can be a measure both of the productivity and the intensity of
labour. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In every country there is a certain average
intensity of labour below which the labour for the production of a commodity
requires more than the socially necessary time, and therefore does not reckon
as labour of normal quality. Only a degree of intensity above the national
average affects, in a given country, the measure of value by the mere duration
of the working-time. This is not the case on the universal market, whose
integral parts are the individual countries. The average intensity of labour
changes from country to country; here it is greater, there less. These national
averages form a scale, whose unit of measure is the average unit of universal
labour. The more intense national labour, therefore, as compared with the less
intense, produces in the same time more value, which expresses itself in more
money. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But the law of value in its international
application is yet more modified by the fact that on the world-market the more
productive national labour reckons also as the more intense, so long as the
more productive nation is not compelled by competition to lower the selling
price of its commodities to the level of their value. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In proportion as capitalist production is
developed in a country, in the same proportion do the national intensity and
productivity of labour there rise above the international level.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn805" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref805"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a> The different quantities of commodities of
the same kind, produced in different countries in the same working-time, have,
therefore, unequal international values, which are expressed in different
prices, i.e., in sums of money varying according to international values. The
relative value of money will, therefore, be less in the nation with more
developed capitalist mode of production than in the nation with less developed.
It follows, then, that the nominal wages, the equivalent of labour-power
expressed in money, will also be higher in the first nation than in the second;
which does not at all prove that this holds also for the real wages, i.e., for
the means of subsistence placed at the disposal of the labourer. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But even apart from these relative differences
of the value of money in different countries, it will be found, frequently,
that the daily or weekly, &amp;tc., wage in the first nation is higher than in
the second, whilst the relative price of labour, i.e., the price of labour as
compared both with surplus-value and with the value of the product, stands
higher in the second than in the first.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn806" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref806"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">J. W. Cowell, member of the Factory Commission
of 1833, after careful investigation of the spinning trade, came to the
conclusion that</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“in England
wages are virtually lower to the capitalist, though higher to the operative
than on the Continent of Europe.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn807" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref807"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The English Factory Inspector, Alexander
Redgrave, in his report of Oct. 31st, 1866, proves by comparative statistics
with continental states, that in spite of lower wages and much longer
working-time, continental labour is, in proportion to the product, dearer than
English. An English manager of a cotton factory in Oldenburg declares that the
working time there lasted from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturdays included, and
that the workpeople there, when under English overlookers, did not supply
during this time quite so much product as the English in 10 hours, but under
German overlookers much less. Wages are much lower than in England, in many
cases 50%, but the number of hands in proportion to the machinery was much
greater, in certain departments in the proportion of 5:3. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Redgrave gives very full details as to the
Russian cotton factories. The data were given him by an English manager until
recently employed there. On this Russian soil, so fruitful of all infamies, the
old horrors of the early days of English factories are in full swing. The
managers are, of course, English, as the native Russian capitalist is of no use
in factory business. Despite all over-work, continued day and night, despite
the most shameful under-payment of the workpeople, Russian manufacture manages
to vegetate only by prohibition of foreign competition. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I give, in conclusion, a comparative table of
Mr. Redgrave’s, on the average number of spindles per factory and per spinner
in the different countries of Europe. He himself remarks that he had collected
these figures a few years ago, and that since that time the size of the
factories and the number of spindles per labourer in England has increased. He
supposes, however, an approximately equal progress in the continental countries
mentioned, so that the numbers given would still have their value for purposes
of comparison. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“This comparison,” says Mr. Redgrave, “is yet
more unfavorable to Great Britain, inasmuch as there is so large a number of
factories in which weaving by power is carried on in conjunction with spinning”
(whilst in the table the weavers are not deducted), “and the factories abroad
are chiefly spinning factories; if it were possible to compare like with like,
strictly, I could find many cotton spinning factories in my district in which
mules containing 2,200 spindles are minded by one man (the minder) and two
assistants only, turning off daily 220 lbs. of yarn, measuring 400 miles in
length.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn808" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref808"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is well known that in Eastern Europe, as well
as in Asia, English companies have undertaken the construction of railways, and
have, in making them, employed side by side with the native labourers, a
certain number of English working-men. Compelled by practical necessity, they
thus have had to take into account the national difference in the intensity of
labour, but this has brought them no loss. Their experience shows that even if
the height of wages corresponds more or less with the average intensity of
labour, the relative price of labour varies generally in the inverse direction.
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In an “Essay on the Rate of Wages,”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn809" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref809"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> one of his first economic writings, H.
Carey tries to prove that the wages of the different nations are directly
proportional to the degree of productiveness of the national working days, in
order to draw from this international relation the conclusion that wages
everywhere rise and fall in proportion to the productiveness of labour. The
whole of our analysis of the production of surplus-value shows the absurdity of
this conclusion, even if Carey himself had proved his premises instead of,
after his usual uncritical and superficial fashion, shuffling to and fro a
confused mass of statistical materials. The best of it is that he does not
assert that things actually are as they ought to be according to his theory.
For State intervention has falsified the natural economic relations. The
different national wages must be reckoned, therefore, as if that part of each
that goes to the State in the form of taxes, came to the labourer himself.
Ought not Mr. Carey to consider further whether those “State expenses” are not
the “natural” fruits of capitalistic development? The reasoning is quite worthy
of the man who first declared the relations of capitalist production to be eternal
laws of nature and reason, whose free, harmonious working is only disturbed by
the intervention of the State, in order afterwards to discover that the
diabolical influence of England on the world market (an influence which, it
appears, does not spring from the natural laws of capitalist production)
necessitates State intervention, i.e., the protection of those laws of nature
and reason by the State, alias the System of Protection. He discovered further
that the theorems of Ricardo and others, in which existing social antagonisms
and contradictions are formulated, are not the ideal product of the real
economic movement, but on the contrary, that the real antagonisms of capitalist
production in England and elsewhere are the result of the theories of Ricardo
and others! Finally he discovered that it is, in the last resort, commerce that
destroys the inborn beauties and harmonies of the capitalist mode of
production. A step further and he will, perhaps, discover that the one evil in
capitalist production is capital itself. Only a man with such atrocious want of
the critical faculty and such spurious erudition deserved, in spite of his
Protectionist heresy, to become the secret source of the harmonious wisdom of a
