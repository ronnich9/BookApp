<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Whatever
the form of the process of production in a society, it must be a continuous
process, must continue to go periodically through the same phases. A society
can no more cease to produce than it can cease to consume. When viewed,
therefore, as a connected whole, and as flowing on with incessant renewal,
every social process of production is, at the same time, a process of
reproduction. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
conditions of production are also those of reproduction. No society can go on
producing, in other words, no society can reproduce, unless it constantly
reconverts a part of its products into means of production, or elements of
fresh products. All other circumstances remaining the same, the only mode by
which it can reproduce its wealth, and maintain it at one level, is by
replacing the means of production – <em class="calibre4">i.e., </em>the instruments of labour,
the raw material, and the auxiliary substances consumed in the course of the
year – by an equal quantity of the same kind of articles; these must be
separated from the mass of the yearly products, and thrown afresh into the
process of production. Hence, a definite portion of each year’s product belongs
to the domain of production. Destined for productive consumption from the very
first, this portion exists, for the most part, in the shape of articles totally
unfitted for individual consumption. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If
production be capitalistic in form, so, too, will be reproduction. Just as in
the former the labour process figures but as a means towards the self-expansion
of capital, so in the latter it figures but as a means of reproducing as
capital – <em class="calibre4">i.e</em>., as self-expanding value – the value advanced. It is
only because his money constantly functions as capital that the economic guise
of a capitalist attaches to a man. If, for instance, a sum of £100 has this
year been converted into capital, and produced a surplus-value of £20, it must
continue during next year, and subsequent years, to repeat the same operation.
As a periodic increment of the capital advanced, or periodic fruit of capital
in process, surplus-value acquires the form of a revenue flowing out of
capital.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn810" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref810"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If this
revenue serve the capitalist only as a fund to provide for his consumption, and
be spent as periodically as it is gained, then, <em class="calibre4">caeteris paribus, </em>simple
reproduction will take place. And although this reproduction is a mere
repetition of the process of production on the old scale, yet this mere
repetition, or continuity, gives a new character to the process, or, rather,
causes the disappearance of some apparent characteristics which it possessed as
an isolated discontinuous process. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
purchase of labour-power for a fixed period is the prelude to the process of
production; and this prelude is constantly repeated when the stipulated term comes
to an end, when a definite period of production, such as a week or a month, has
elapsed. But the labourer is not paid until after he has expended his
labour-power, and realised in commodities not only its value, but surplus-value.
He has, therefore, produced not only surplus-value, which we for the present
regard as a fund to meet the private consumption of the capitalist, but he has
also produced, before it flows back to him in the shape of wages, the fund out
of which he himself is paid, the variable capital; and his employment lasts
only so long as he continues to reproduce this fund. Hence, that formula of the
economists, referred to in Chapter XVIII, which represents wages as a share in
the product itself.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn811" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref811"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a> What
flows back to the labourer in the shape of wages is a portion of the product
that is continuously reproduced by him. The capitalist, it is true, pays him in
money, but this money is merely the transmuted form of the product of his labour.
While he is converting a portion of the means of production into products, a
portion of his former product is being turned into money. It is his labour of
last week, or of last year, that pays for his labour-power this week or this
year. The illusion begotten by the intervention of money vanishes immediately,
if, instead of taking a single capitalist and a single labourer, we take the
class of capitalists and the class of labourers as a whole. The capitalist
class is constantly giving to the labouring class order-notes, in the form of
money, on a portion of the commodities produced by the latter and appropriated
by the former. The labourers give these order-notes back just as constantly to
the capitalist class, and in this way get their share of their own product. The
transaction is veiled by the commodity form of the product and the money form
of the commodity. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Variable
capital is therefore only a particular historical form of appearance of the
fund for providing the necessaries of life, or the labour-fund which the
labourer requires for the maintenance of himself and family, and which,
whatever be the system of social production, he must himself produce and
reproduce. If the labour-fund constantly flows to him in the form of money that
pays for his labour, it is because the product he has created moves constantly
away from him in the form of capital. But all this does not alter the fact,
that it is the labourer’s own labour, realised in a product, which is advanced
to him by the capitalist.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn812" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref812"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a> Let us
take a peasant liable to do compulsory service for his lord. He works on his
own land, with his own means of production, for, say, 3 days a week. The 3
other days he does forced work on the lord’s domain. He constantly reproduces
his own labour-fund, which never, in his case, takes the form of a money
payment for his labour, advanced by another person. But in return, his unpaid
forced labour for the lord, on its side, never acquires the character of
voluntary paid labour. If one fine morning the lord appropriates to himself the
land, the cattle, the seed, in a word, the, means of production of this
peasant, the latter will thenceforth be obliged to sell his labour-power to the
lord. He will, <em class="calibre4">ceteris paribus</em><em class="calibre4"><span class="calibre48">, labour</span></em> 6 days a week as before, 3 for
himself, 3 for his lord, who thenceforth becomes a wages-paying capitalist. As
before, he will use up the means of production as means of production, and
transfer their value to the product. As before, a definite portion of the
product will be devoted to reproduction. But from the moment that the forced
labour is changed into wage labour, from that moment the labour-fund, which the
peasant himself continues as before to produce and reproduce, takes the form of
a capital advanced in the form of wages by the lord. The bourgeois economist
whose narrow mind is unable to separate the form of appearance from the thing
that appears, shuts his eyes to the fact, that it is but here and there on the
face of the earth, that even nowadays the labour fund crops up in the form of
capital.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn813" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref813"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Variable
capital, it is true, only then loses its character of a value advanced out of
the capitalist’s funds, <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn814" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref814"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> when we
view the process of capitalist production in the flow of its constant renewal.
But that process must have had a beginning of some kind. From our present
standpoint it therefore seems likely that the capitalist, once upon a time,
became possessed of money, by some accumulation that took place independently
of the unpaid labour of others, and that this was, therefore, how he was
enabled to frequent the market as a buyer of labour-power. However this may be,
the mere continuity of the process, the simple reproduction, brings about some
other wonderful changes, which affect not only the variable, but the total
capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If a
capital of £1,000 beget yearly a surplus-value of £200, and if this surplus-value
be consumed every year, it is clear that at the end of 5 years the surplus-value
consumed will amount to 5 × £200 or the £1,000 originally advanced. If only a
part, say one half, were consumed, the same result would follow at the end of
10 years, since 10 × £100= £1,000. General Rule: The value of the capital
advanced divided by the surplus-value annually consumed, gives the number of
years, or reproduction periods, at the expiration of which the capital
originally advanced has been consumed by the capitalist and has disappeared.
The capitalist thinks, that he is consuming the produce of the unpaid labour of
others, <em class="calibre4">i.e</em>., the surplus-value, and is keeping intact his original
capital; but what he thinks cannot alter facts. After the lapse of a certain
number of years, the capital value he then possesses is equal to the sum total
of the surplus-value appropriated by him during those years, and the total
value he has consumed is equal to that of his original capital. It is true, he
has in hand a capital whose amount has not changed, and of which a part, viz.,
the buildings, machinery, &amp;c., were already there when the work of his
business began. But what we have to do with here, is not the material elements,
but the value, of that capital. When a person gets through all his property, by
taking upon himself debts equal to the value of that property, it is clear that
his property represents nothing but the sum total of his debts. And so it is
with the capitalist; when he has consumed the equivalent of his original
capital, the value of his present capital represents nothing but the total
amount of the surplus-value appropriated by him without payment. Not a single
atom of the value of his old capital continues to exist. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Apart then
from all accumulation, the mere continuity of the process of production, in
other words simple reproduction, sooner or later, and of necessity, converts
every capital into accumulated capital, or capitalised surplus-value. Even if
that capital was originally acquired by the personal labour of its employer, it
sooner or later becomes value appropriated without an equivalent, the unpaid
labour of others materialised either in money or in some other object. We saw
in Chapt. IV.-VI. that in order to convert money into capital something more is
required than the production and circulation of commodities. We saw that on the
one side the possessor of value or money, on the other, the possessor of the
value-creating substance; on the one side, the possessor of the means of
production and subsistence, on the other, the possessor of nothing but
labour-power, must confront one another as buyer and seller. The separation of
labour from its product, of subjective labour-power from the objective
conditions of labour, was therefore the real foundation in fact, and the
starting-point of capitalist production. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But that
which at first was but a starting-point, becomes, by the mere continuity of the
process, by simple reproduction, the peculiar result, constantly renewed and
perpetuated, of capitalist production. On the one hand, the process of
production incessantly converts material wealth into capital, into means of
creating more wealth and means of enjoyment for the capitalist. On the other
hand, the labourer, on quitting the process, is what he was on entering it, a
source of wealth, but devoid of all means of making that wealth his own. Since,
before entering on the process, his own labour has already been alienated from
himself by the sale of his labour-power, has been appropriated by the capitalist
and incorporated with capital, it must, during the process, be realised in a
product that does not belong to him. Since the process of production is also
the process by which the capitalist consumes labour-power, the product of the
labourer is incessantly converted, not only into commodities, but into capital,
into value that sucks up the value-creating power, into means of subsistence
that buy the person of the labourer, into means of production that command the
producers.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn815" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref815"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> The labourer therefore
constantly produces material, objective wealth, but in the form of capital, of
an alien power that dominates and exploits him; and the capitalist as
constantly produces labour-power, but in the form of a subjective source of
wealth, separated from the objects in and by which it can alone be realised; in
short he produces the labourer, but as a wage labourer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn816" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref816"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a> This incessant reproduction, this
perpetuation of the labourer, is the sine quâ non of capitalist production. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
labourer consumes in a two-fold way. While producing he consumes by his labour
the means of production, and converts them into products with a higher value
than that of the capital advanced. This is his productive consumption. It is at
the same time consumption of his labour-power by the capitalist who bought it.
On the other hand, the labourer turns the money paid to him for his
labour-power, into means of subsistence: this is his individual consumption.
The labourer’s productive consumption, and his individual consumption, are
therefore totally distinct. In the former, he acts as the motive power of
capital, and belongs to the capitalist. In the latter, he belongs to himself,
and performs his necessary vital functions outside the process of production.
The result of the one is, that the capitalist lives; of the other, that the
labourer lives. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When
treating of the working day, we saw that the labourer is often compelled to
make his individual consumption a mere incident of production. In such a case,
he supplies himself with necessaries in order to maintain his labour-power,
just as coal and water are supplied to the steam-engine and oil to the wheel.
His means of consumption, in that case, are the mere means of consumption
required by a means of production; his individual consumption is directly productive
consumption. This, however, appears to be an abuse not essentially appertaining
to capitalist production.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn817" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref817"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The matter
takes quite another aspect, when we contemplate, not the single capitalist, and
the single labourer, but the capitalist class and the labouring class, not an
isolated process of production, but capitalist production in full swing, and on
its actual social scale. By converting part of his capital into labour-power,
the capitalist augments the value of his entire capital. He kills two birds
with one stone. He profits, not only by what he receives from, but by what he
gives to, the labourer. The capital given in exchange for labour-power is
converted into necessaries, by the consumption of which the muscles, nerves,
bones, and brains of existing labourers are reproduced, and new labourers are
begotten. Within the limits of what is strictly necessary, the individual
consumption of the working class is, therefore, the reconversion of the means
of subsistence given by capital in exchange for labour-power, into fresh
labour-power at the disposal of capital for exploitation. It is the production
and reproduction of that means of production so indispensable to the
capitalist: the labourer himself. The individual consumption of the labourer, whether
it proceed within the workshop or outside it, whether it be part of the process
of production or not, forms therefore a factor of the production and
reproduction of capital; just as cleaning machinery does, whether it be done
while the machinery is working or while it is standing. The fact that the
labourer consumes his means of subsistence for his own purposes, and not to
please the capitalist, has no bearing on the matter. The consumption of food by
a beast of burden is none the less a necessary factor in the process of
production, because the beast enjoys what it eats. The maintenance and
reproduction of the working class is, and must ever be, a necessary condition
to the reproduction of capital. But the capitalist may safely leave its
fulfilment to the labourer’s instincts of self-preservation and of propagation.
All the capitalist cares for, is to reduce the labourer’s individual
consumption as far as possible to what is strictly necessary, and he is far
away from imitating those brutal South Americans, who force their labourers to
take the more substantial, rather than the less substantial, kind of food.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn818" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref818"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hence both
the capitalist and his ideological representative, the political economist,
consider that part alone of the labourer’s individual consumption to be
productive, which is requisite for the perpetuation of the class, and which
therefore must take place in order that the capitalist may have labour-power to
consume; what the labourer consumes for his own pleasure beyond that part, is
unproductive consumption.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn819" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref819"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a> If the
accumulation of capital were to cause a rise of wages and an increase in the
labourer’s consumption, unaccompanied by increase in the consumption of
labour-power by capital, the additional capital would be consumed
unproductively.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn820" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref820"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a> In
reality, the individual consumption of the labourer is unproductive as regards
himself, for it reproduces nothing but the needy individual; it is productive
to the capitalist and to the State, since it is the production of the power
that creates their wealth.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn821" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref821"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From a
social point of view, therefore, the working class, even when not directly
engaged in the labour process, is just as much an appendage of capital as the
ordinary instruments of labour. Even its individual consumption is, within
certain limits, a mere factor in the process of production. That process,
however, takes good care to prevent these self-conscious instruments from
leaving it in the lurch, for it removes their product, as fast as it is made,
from their pole to the opposite pole of capital. Individual consumption
provides, on the one hand, the means for their maintenance and reproduction: on
the other hand, it secures by the annihilation of the necessaries of life, the
continued re-appearance of the workman in the labour-market. The Roman slave
was held by fetters: the wage labourer is bound to his owner by invisible
threads. The appearance of independence is kept up by means of a constant
change of employers, and by the fictio juris of a contract. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In former
times, capital resorted to legislation, whenever necessary, to enforce its
proprietary rights over the free labourer. For instance, down to 1815, the
emigration of mechanics employed in machine making was, in England, forbidden,
under grievous pains and penalties. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
reproduction of the working class carries with it the accumulation of skill,
that is handed down from one generation to another.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn822" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref822"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">13</span></a> To what extent the capitalist reckons the
existence of such a skilled class among the factors of production that belong
to him by right, and to what extent he actually regards it as the reality of
his variable capital, is seen so soon as a crisis threatens him with its loss.
In consequence of the civil war in the United States and of the accompanying
cotton famine, the majority of the cotton operatives in Lancashire were, as is
well known, thrown out of work. Both from the working class itself, and from
other ranks of society, there arose a cry for State aid, or for voluntary
national subscriptions, in order to enable the “superfluous” hands to emigrate
to the colonies or to the United States. Thereupon, <em class="calibre4">The Times </em>published
on the 24th March, 1863, a letter from Edmund Potter, a former president of the
Manchester Chamber of Commerce. This letter was rightly called in the House of
Commons, the manufacturers’ manifesto.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn823" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref823"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">14</span></a>
We cull here a few characteristic passages, in which the proprietary rights of
capital over labour-power are unblushingly asserted. </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“He” (the man
out of work) “may be told the supply of cotton-workers is too large ... and ...
must ... in fact be reduced by a third, perhaps, and that then there will be a
healthy demand for the remaining two-thirds.... Public opinion... urges
emigration.... The master cannot willingly see his labour supply being removed;
he may think, and perhaps justly, that it is both wrong and unsound.... But if
the public funds are to be devoted to assist emigration, he bas a right to be
heard, and perhaps to protest.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. Potter then shows how useful the cotton
trade is, how the “trade has undoubtedly drawn the surplus-population from
Ireland and from the agricultural districts,” how immense is its extent, how in
the year 1860 it yielded 5/13 ths of the total English exports, how, after a
few years, it will again expand by the extension of the market, particularly of
the Indian market, and by calling forth a plentiful supply of cotton at 6d. per
lb. He then continues:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Some time
...,one, two, or three years, it may be, will produce the quantity.... The
question I would put then is this – Is the trade worth retaining? Is it worth
while to keep the machinery (he means the living labour machines) in order, and
is it not the greatest folly to think of parting with that? I think it is. I
allow that the workers are not a property, not the property of Lancashire and
the masters; but they are the strength of both; they are the mental and trained
power which cannot be. replaced for a generation; the mere machinery which they
work might much of it be beneficially replaced, nay improved, in a twelvemonth <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn824" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref824"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">15</span></a> Encourage or allow (!) the working-power
to emigrate, and what of the capitalist?... Take away the cream of the workers,
and fixed capital will depreciate in a great degree, and the floating will not
subject itself to a struggle with the short supply of inferior labour.... We
are told the workers wish it” (emigration). “Very natural it is that they
should do so.... Reduce, compress the cotton trade by taking away its working
power and reducing their wages expenditure, say one-fifth, or five millions,
and what then would happen to the class above, the small shopkeepers; and what
of the rents, the cottage rents.... Trace out the effects upwards to the small
farmer, the better householder, and ... the landowner, and say if there could
be any suggestion more suicidal to all classes of the country than by
enfeebling a nation by exporting the best of its manufacturing population, and
destroying the value of some of its most productive capital and enrichment ....
I advise a loan (of five or six millions sterling), ... extending it may be
over two or three years, administered by special commissioners added to the
Boards of Guardians in the cotton districts, under special legislative
regulations, enforcing some occupation or labour, as a means of keeping up at
least the moral standard of the recipients of the loan... can anything be worse
for landowners or masters than parting with the best of the workers, and
demoralising and disappointing the rest by an extended depletive emigration, a
depletion of capital and value in an entire province?” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Potter, the chosen mouthpiece of the
manufacturers, distinguishes two sorts of “machinery,” each of which belongs to
the capitalist, and of which one stands in his factory, the other at night-time
and on Sundays is housed outside the factory, in cottages. The one is
inanimate, the other living. The inanimate machinery not only wears out and
depreciates from day to day, but a great part of it becomes so quickly
superannuated, by constant technical progress, that it can be replaced with
advantage by new machinery after a few months. The living machinery, on the
contrary gets better the longer it lasts, and in proportion as the skill,
handed from one generation to another, accumulates. <i class="calibre4">The Times </i>answered
the cotton lord as follows:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Mr. Edmund
Potter is so impressed with the exceptional and supreme importance of the
cotton masters that, in order to preserve this class and perpetuate their
profession, he would keep half a million of the labouring class confined in a
great moral workhouse against their will. ‘Is the trade worth retaining?’ asks
Mr. Potter. ‘Certainly by all honest means it is,’ we answer. ‘Is it worth
while keeping the machinery in order?’ again asks Mr. Potter. Here we hesitate.
By the ‘machinery’ Mr. Potter means the human machinery, for he goes on to
protest that he does not mean to use them as an absolute property. We must
confess that we do not think it ‘worth while,’ or even possible, to keep the
human machinery in order – that is to shut it up and keep it oiled till it is
wanted. Human machinery will rust under inaction, oil and rub it as you may.
Moreover, the human machinery will, as we have just seen, get the steam up of
its own accord, and burst or run amuck in our great towns. It might, as Mr.
Potter says, require some time to reproduce the workers, but, having machinists
and capitalists at hand, we could always find thrifty, hard, industrious men
wherewith to improvise more master manufacturers than we can ever want. Mr.
Potter talks of the trade reviving ‘in one, two, or three years,’ and he asks
us not ‘to encourage or allow (!) the working power to emigrate.’<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn825" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref825"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">16</span></a> He says that it is very natural the
workers should wish to emigrate; but he thinks that in spite of their desire,
the nation ought to keep this half million of workers with their 700,000
dependents, shut up in the cotton districts; and as a necessary consequence, he
must of course think that the nation ought to keep down their discontent by
force, and sustain them by alms – and upon the chance that the cotton masters may
some day want them.... The time is come when the great public opinion of these
islands must operate to save this ‘working power’ from those who would deal
with it as they would deal with iron, and coal, and cotton.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">The Times’</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> article was only a jeu d’esprit. The “great public
opinion” was, in fact, of Mr. Potter’s opinion, that the factory operatives are
part of the movable fittings of a factory. Their emigration was prevented. They
were locked up in that “moral workhouse,” the cotton districts, and they form,
as before, “the strength” of the cotton manufacturers of Lancashire. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Capitalist
production, therefore, of itself reproduces the separation between labour-power
and the means of labour. It thereby reproduces and perpetuates the condition
for exploiting the labourer. It incessantly forces him to sell his labour-power
in order to live, and enables the capitalist to purchase labour-power in order
that he may enrich himself.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn826" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref826"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">17</span></a> It is no
longer a mere accident, that capitalist and labourer confront each other in the
market as buyer and seller. It is the process itself that incessantly hurls
back the labourer on to the market as a vendor of his labour-power, and that
incessantly converts his own product into a means by which another man can
purchase him. In reality, the labourer belongs to capital before he has sold
himself to capital. His economic bondage<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn827" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref827"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">18</span></a><span>  </span>is both brought about and concealed by the
periodic sale of himself, by his change of masters, and by the oscillations in
the market-price of labour-power.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn828" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref828"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">19</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Capitalist
production, therefore, under its aspect of a continuous connected process, of a
process of reproduction, produces not only commodities, not only surplus-value,
but it also produces and reproduces the capitalist relation; on the one side the
capitalist, on the other the wage labourer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_056.htm#_edn829" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref829"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">20</span></a>
