that Accompanies Accumulation, the Composition of Capital Remaining the same</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In this chapter we consider the influence of the
growth of capital on the lot of the labouring class. The most important factor
in this inquiry is the composition of capital and the changes it undergoes in
the course of the process of accumulation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The composition of capital is to be understood
in a two-fold sense. On the side of value, it is determined by the proportion
in which it is divided into constant capital or value of the means of
production, and variable capital or value of labour power, the sum total of
wages. On the side of material, as it functions in the process of production,
all capital is divided into means of production and living labour power. This
latter composition is determined by the relation between the mass of the means
of production employed, on the one hand, and the mass of labour necessary for
their employment on the other. I call the former the <i class="calibre4">value-composition</i>,
the latter the <i class="calibre4">technical composition</i> of capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Between the two there is a strict correlation. To
express this, I call the value composition of capital, in so far as it is
determined by its technical composition and mirrors the changes of the latter,
the <i class="calibre4">organic composition</i> of capital. Wherever I refer to the composition
of capital, without further qualification, its organic composition is always
understood. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The many individual capitals invested in a
particular branch of production have, one with another, more or less different
compositions. The average of their individual compositions gives us the composition
of the total capital in this branch of production. Lastly, the average of these
averages, in all branches of production, gives us the composition of the total
social capital of a country, and with this alone are we, in the last resort,
concerned in the following investigation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Growth of capital involves growth of its
variable constituent or of the part invested in labour power. A part of the surplus-value
turned into additional capital must always be re-transformed into variable
capital, or additional labour fund. If we suppose that, all other circumstances
remaining the same, the composition of capital also remains constant (<i class="calibre4">i.e</i>.,
that a definite mass of means of production constantly needs the same mass of
labour power to set it in motion), then the demand for labour and the
subsistence-fund of the labourers clearly increase in the same proportion as
the capital, and the more rapidly, the more rapidly the capital increases.
Since the capital produces yearly a surplus-value, of which one part is yearly
added to the original capital; since this increment itself grows yearly along
with the augmentation of the capital already functioning; since lastly, under
special stimulus to enrichment, such as the opening of new markets, or of new
spheres for the outlay of capital in consequence of newly developed social
wants, &amp;c., the scale of accumulation may be suddenly extended, merely by a
change in the division of the surplus-value or surplus-product into capital and
revenue, the requirements of accumulating capital may exceed the increase of
labour power or of the number of labourers; the demand for labourers may exceed
the supply, and, therefore, wages may rise. This must, indeed, ultimately be
the case if the conditions supposed above continue. For since in each year more
labourers are employed than in its predecessor, sooner or later a point must be
reached, at which the requirements of accumulation begin to surpass the
customary supply of labour, and, therefore, a rise of wages takes place. A
lamentation on this score was heard in England during the whole of the
fifteenth, and the first half of the eighteenth centuries. The more or less
favourable circumstances in which the wage working class supports and
multiplies itself, in no way alter the fundamental character of capitalist
production. As simple reproduction constantly reproduces the capital relation
itself, <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>., the relation of capitalists on the one hand, and wage
workers on the other, so reproduction on a progressive scale, <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>.,
accumulation, reproduces the capital relation on a progressive scale, more
capitalists or larger capitalists at this pole, more wage workers at that. The
reproduction of a mass of labour power, which must incessantly re-incorporate
itself with capital for that capital’s self-expansion; which cannot get free
from capital, and whose enslavement to capital is only concealed by the variety
of individual capitalists to whom it sells itself, this reproduction of labour
power forms, in fact, an essential of the reproduction of capital itself.
Accumulation of capital is, therefore, increase of the proletariat.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn886" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref886"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Classical economy grasped this fact so
thoroughly that Adam Smith, Ricardo, &amp;c., as mentioned earlier,
inaccurately identified accumulation with the consumption, by the productive
labourers, of all the capitalised part of the surplus-product, or with its
transformation into additional wage labourers. As early as 1696 John Bellers
says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“For if one
had a hundred thousand acres of land and as many pounds in money, and as many cattle,
without a labourer, what would the rich man be, but a labourer? And as the
labourers make men rich, so the more labourers there will be, the more rich men
... the labour of the poor being the mines of the rich.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn887" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref887"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So also Bernard de Mandeville at the beginning
of the eighteenth century:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“It would be
easier, where property is well secured, to live without money than without
poor; for who would do the work? ... As they [the poor] ought to be kept from
starving, so they should receive nothing worth saving. If here and there one of
the lowest class by uncommon industry, and pinching his belly, lifts himself
above the condition he was brought up in, nobody ought to hinder him; nay, it
is undeniably the wisest course for every person in the society, and for every
private family to be frugal; but it is the interest of all rich nations, that
the greatest part of the poor should almost never be idle, and yet continually
spend what they get.... Those that get their living by their daily labour ...
have nothing to stir them up to be serviceable but their wants which it is
prudence to relieve, but folly to cure. The only thing then that can render the
labouring man industrious, is a moderate quantity of money, for as too little
will, according as his temper is, either dispirit or make him desperate, so too
much will make him insolent and lazy.... From what has been said, it is
manifest, that, in a free nation, where slaves are not allowed of, the surest
wealth consists in a multitude of laborious poor; for besides, that they are
the never-failing nursery of fleets and armies, without them there could be no
enjoyment, and no product of any country could be valuable. “To make the
society” [which of course consists of non-workers] “happy and people easier
under the meanest circumstances, it is requisite that great numbers of them
should be ignorant as well as poor; knowledge both enlarges and multiplies our
desires, and the fewer things a man wishes for, the more easily his necessities
may be supplied.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn888" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref888"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">What Mandeville, an honest, clear-headed man,
had not yet seen, is that the mechanism of the process of accumulation itself
increases, along with the capital, the mass of “labouring poor,” <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>.,
the wage labourers, who turn their labour power into an increasing power of self-expansion
of the growing capital, and even by doing so must eternise their dependent
relation on their own product, as personified in the capitalists. In reference
to this relation of dependence, Sir F. M. Eden in his “The State of the Poor,
an History of the Labouring Classes in England,” says, </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“the natural
produce of our soil is certainly not fully adequate to our subsistence; we can
neither be clothed, lodged nor fed but in consequence of some previous labour.
A portion at least of the society must be indefatigably employed .... There are
others who, though they ‘neither toil nor spin,’ can yet command the produce of
industry, but who owe their exemption from labour solely to civilisation and
order .... They are peculiarly the creatures of civil institutions,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn889" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref889"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> which have recognised that individuals may
acquire property by various other means besides the exertion of labour....
Persons of independent fortune ... owe their superior advantages by no means to
any superior abilities of their own, but almost entirely ... to the industry of
others. It is not the possession of land, or of money, but the command of
labour which distinguishes the opulent from the labouring part of the community
.... This [scheme approved by Eden] would give the people of property
sufficient (but by no means too much) influence and authority over those who
... work for them; and it would place such labourers, not in an abject or
servile condition, but in such a state of easy and liberal dependence as all
who know human nature, and its history, will allow to be necessary for their
own comfort.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn890" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref890"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Sir F. M. Eden, it may be remarked in passing,
is the only disciple of Adam Smith during the eighteenth century that produced
any work of importance.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn891" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref891"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Under the conditions of accumulation supposed
thus far, which conditions are those most favourable to the labourers, their
relation of dependence upon capital takes on a form endurable or, as Eden says:
“easy and liberal.” Instead of becoming more intensive with the growth of
capital, this relation of dependence only becomes more extensive, <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>.,
the sphere of capital’s exploitation and rule merely extends with its own
dimensions and the number of its subjects. A larger part of their own
surplus-product, always increasing and continually transformed into additional
capital, comes back to them in the shape of means of payment, so that they can
extend the circle of their enjoyments; can make some additions to their
consumption-fund of clothes, furniture, &amp;c., and can lay by small reserve
funds of money. But just as little as better clothing, food, and treatment, and
a larger peculium, do away with the exploitation of the slave, so little do
they set aside that of the wage worker. A rise in the price of labour, as a
consequence of accumulation of capital, only means, in fact, that the length
and weight of the golden chain the wage worker has already forged for himself,
allow of a relaxation of the tension of it. In the controversies on this
subject the chief fact has generally been overlooked, viz., the <i class="calibre4">differentia
specifica</i> [defining characteristic] of capitalistic production. Labour
power is sold today, not with a view of satisfying, by its service or by its
product, the personal needs of the buyer. His aim is augmentation of his
capital, production of commodities containing more labour than he pays for,
containing therefore a portion of value that costs him nothing, and that is
nevertheless realised when the commodities are sold. Production of surplus-value
is the absolute law of this mode of production. Labour-power is only saleable
so far as it preserves the means of production in their capacity of capital,
reproduces its own value as capital, and yields in unpaid labour a source of
additional capital.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn892" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref892"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a> The
conditions of its sale, whether more or less favourable to the labourer,
include therefore the necessity of its constant re-selling, and the constantly
extended reproduction of all wealth in the shape of capital. Wages, as we have
seen, by their very nature, always imply the performance of a certain quantity
of unpaid labour on the part of the labourer. Altogether, irrespective of the
case of a rise of wages with a falling price of labour, &amp;c., such an
increase only means at best a quantitative diminution of the unpaid labour that
the worker has to supply. This diminution can never reach the point at which it
would threaten the system itself. Apart from violent conflicts as to the rate
of wages (and Adam Smith has already shown that in such a conflict, taken on
the whole, the master is always master), a rise in the price of labour
resulting from accumulation of capital implies the following alternative: </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Either the price of labour keeps on rising,
because its rise does not interfere with the progress of accumulation. In this
there is nothing wonderful, for, says Adam Smith, “after these (profits) are
diminished, stock may not only continue to increase, but to increase much
faster than before.... A great stock, though with small profits, generally
increases faster than a small stock with great profits.” (l. c., ii, p. 189.)
In this case it is evident that a diminution in the unpaid labour in no way
interferes with the extension of the domain of capital. – Or, on the other
hand, accumulation slackens in consequence of the rise in the price of labour,
because the stimulus of gain is blunted. The rate of accumulation lessens; but
with its lessening, the primary cause of that lessening vanishes, <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>.,
the disproportion between capital and exploitable labour power. The mechanism
of the process of capitalist production removes the very obstacles that it
temporarily creates. The price of labour falls again to a level corresponding
with the needs of the self-expansion of capital, whether the level be below,
the same as, or above the one which was normal before the rise of wages took
place. We see thus: In the first case, it is not the diminished rate either of
the absolute, or of the proportional, increase in labour power, or labouring
population, which causes capital to be in excess, but conversely the excess of
capital that makes exploitable labour power insufficient. In the second case,
it is not the increased rate either of the absolute, or of the proportional,
increase in labour power, or labouring population, that makes capital
insufficient; but, conversely, the relative diminution of capital that causes
the exploitable labour power, or rather its price, to be in excess. It is these
absolute movements of the accumulation of capital which are reflected as
relative movements of the mass of exploitable labour power, and therefore seem
produced by the latter’s own independent movement. To put it mathematically:
the rate of accumulation is the independent, not the dependent, variable; the
rate of wages, the dependent, not the independent, variable. Thus, when the industrial
cycle is in the phase of crisis, a general fall in the price of commodities is
expressed as a rise in the value of money, and, in the phase of prosperity, a
general rise in the price of commodities, as a fall in the value of money. The
so-called currency school concludes from this that with high prices too much,
with low prices too little<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn893" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref893"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a><span>  </span>money is in circulation. Their ignorance and
complete misunderstanding of facts<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn894" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref894"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a><span>  </span>are worthily paralleled by the economists,
who interpret the above phenomena of accumulation by saying that there are now
too few, now too many wage labourers. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The law of capitalist production, that is at the
bottom of the pretended “natural law of population,” reduces itself simply to
this: The correlation between accumulation of capital and rate of wages is
nothing else than the correlation between the unpaid labour transformed into
capital, and the additional paid labour necessary for the setting in motion of
this additional capital. It is therefore in no way a relation between two
magnitudes, independent one of the other: on the one hand, the magnitude of the
capital; on the other, the number of the labouring population; it is rather, at
bottom, only the relation between the unpaid and the paid labour of the same
labouring population. If the quantity of unpaid labour supplied by the working
class, and accumulated by the capitalist class, increases so rapidly that its
conversion into capital requires an extraordinary addition of paid labour, then
wages rise, and, all other circumstances remaining equal, the unpaid labour
diminishes in proportion. But as soon as this diminution touches the point at
which the surplus labour that nourishes capital is no longer supplied in normal
quantity, a reaction sets in: a smaller part of revenue is capitalised,
accumulation lags, and the movement of rise in wages receives a check. The rise
of wages therefore is confined within limits that not only leave intact the
foundations of the capitalistic system, but also secure its reproduction on a
progressive scale. The law of capitalistic accumulation, metamorphosed by
economists into pretended law of Nature, in reality merely states that the very
nature of accumulation excludes every diminution in the degree of exploitation
of labour, and every rise in the price of labour, which could seriously imperil
the continual reproduction, on an ever-enlarging scale, of the capitalistic
relation. It cannot be otherwise in a mode of production in which the labourer
exists to satisfy the needs of self-expansion of existing values, instead of,
on the contrary, material wealth existing to satisfy the needs of development
on the part of the labourer. As, in religion, man is governed by the products
of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is governed by the products
of his own hand.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn895" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref895"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a> </span></p>

<h3 class="calibre23"><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="_Toc273516471"></a><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="__RefHeading__818_1418669237"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre20"></span><span class="calibre20"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">Section 2: Relative Diminution of the Variable
Part of Capital Simultaneously with the Progress of Accumulation and of the
Concentration that Accompanies it</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">According to the economists themselves, it is
neither the actual extent of social wealth, nor the magnitude of the capital
already functioning, that lead to a rise of wages, but only the constant growth
of accumulation and the degree of rapidity of that growth. (Adam Smith, Book
I., chapter 8.) So far, we have only considered one special phase of this
process, that in which the increase of capital occurs along with a constant
technical composition of capital. But the process goes beyond this phase. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Once given the general basis of the capitalistic
system, then, in the course of accumulation, a point is reached at which the
development of the productivity of social labour becomes the most powerful
lever of accumulation.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The same
cause,” says Adam Smith, “which raises the wages of labour, the increase of
stock, tends to increase its productive powers, and to make a smaller quantity
of labour produce a greater quantity of work.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn896" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref896"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Apart from natural conditions, such as fertility
of the soil, &amp;c., and from the skill of independent and isolated producers
(shown rather qualitatively in the goodness than quantitatively in the mass of
their products), the degree of productivity of labour, in a given society, is
expressed in the relative extent of the means of production that one labourer,
during a given time, with the same tension of labour power, turns into
products. The mass of the means of production which he thus transforms,
increases with the productiveness of his labour. But those means of production
play a double part. The increase of some is a consequence, that of the others a
condition of the increasing productivity of labour. <i class="calibre4">E.g.,</i> with the
division of labour in manufacture, and with the use of machinery, more raw
material is worked up in the same time, and, therefore, a greater mass of raw
material and auxiliary substances enter into the labour process. That is the
consequence of the increasing productivity of labour. On the other hand, the
mass of machinery, beasts of burden, mineral manures, drain-pipes, &amp;c., is
a condition of the increasing productivity of labour. So also is it with the
means of production concentrated in buildings, furnaces, means of transport,
&amp;c. But whether condition or consequence, the growing extent of the means
of production, as compared with the labour power incorporated with them, is an
expression of the growing productiveness of labour. The increase of the latter
appears, therefore, in the diminution of the mass of labour in proportion to
the mass of means of production moved by it, or in the diminution of the
subjective factor of the labour process as compared with the objective factor. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This change in the technical composition of
capital, this growth in the mass of means of production, as compared with the
mass of the labour power that vivifies them, is reflected again in its value
composition, by the increase of the constant constituent of capital at the
expense of its variable constituent. There may be, <i class="calibre4">e.g.,</i> originally 50
per cent. of a capital laid out in means of production, and 50 per cent. in
labour power; later on, with the development of the productivity of labour, 80
per cent. in means of production, 20 per cent. in labour power, and so on. This
law of the progressive increase in constant capital, in proportion to the
variable, is confirmed at every step (as already shown) by the comparative
analysis of the prices of commodities, whether we compare different economic
epochs or different nations in the same epoch. The relative magnitude of the
element of price, which represents the value of the means of production only,
or the constant part of capital consumed, is in direct, the relative magnitude
of the other element of price that pays labour (the variable part of capital)
is in inverse proportion to the advance of accumulation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This diminution in the variable part of capital
as compared with the constant, or the altered value-composition of the capital,
however, only shows approximately the change in the composition of its material
constituents. If, <i class="calibre4">e.g.,</i> the capital-value employed today in spinning is
7/8 constant and 1/8 variable, whilst at the beginning of the 18th century it
was ½ constant and ½ variable, on the other hand, the mass of raw material,
instruments of labour, &amp;c., that a certain quantity of spinning labour
consumes productively today, is many hundred times greater than at the
beginning of the 18th century. The reason is simply that, with the increasing
productivity of labour, not only does the mass of the means of production
consumed by it increase, but their value compared with their mass diminishes.
Their value therefore rises absolutely, but not in proportion to their mass.
The increase of the difference between constant and variable capital, is,
therefore, much less than that of the difference between the mass of the means
of production into which the constant, and the mass of the labour power into
which the variable, capital is converted. The former difference increases with
the latter, but in a smaller degree. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But, if the progress of accumulation lessens the
relative magnitude of the variable part of capital, it by no means, in doing
this, excludes the possibility of a rise in its absolute magnitude. Suppose
that a capital-value at first is divided into 50 per cent. of constant and 50
per cent. of variable capital; later into 80 per cent. of constant and 20 per
cent. of variable. If in the meantime the original capital, say £6,000, has
increased to £18,000, its variable constituent has also increased. It was
£3,000, it is now £3,600. But where as formerly an increase of capital by 20
per cent. would have sufficed to raise the demand for labour 20 per cent., now
this latter rise requires a tripling of the original capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In Part IV, it was shown, how the development of
the productiveness of social labour presupposes co-operation on a large scale;
how it is only upon this supposition that division and combination of labour
can be organised, and the means of production economised by concentration on a
vast scale; how instruments of labour which, from their very nature, are only
fit for use in common, such as a system of machinery, can be called into being;
how huge natural forces can be pressed into the service of production; and how
the transformation can be effected of the process of production into a
technological application of science. On the basis of the production of commodities,
where the means of production are the property of private persons, and where
the artisan therefore either produces commodities, isolated from and
independent of others, or sells his labour power as a commodity, because he
lacks the means for independent industry, co-operation on a large scale can
realise itself only in the increase of individual capitals, only in proportion
as the means of social production and the means of subsistence are transformed
into the private property of capitalists. The basis of the production of
commodities can admit of production on a large scale in the capitalistic form
alone. A certain accumulation of capital, in the hands of individual producers
of commodities, forms therefore the necessary preliminary of the specifically
capitalistic mode of production. We had, therefore, to assume that this occurs
during the transition from handicraft to capitalistic industry. It may be
called primitive accumulation, because it is the historic basis, instead of the
historic result of specifically capitalist production. How it itself
originates, we need not here inquire as yet. It is enough that it forms the
starting point. But all methods for raising the social productive power of
labour that are developed on this basis, are at the same time methods for the
increased production of surplus-value or surplus-product, which in its turn is
the formative element of accumulation. They are, therefore, at the same time
methods of the production of capital by capital, or methods of its accelerated
accumulation. The continual re-transformation of surplus-value into capital now
appears in the shape of the increasing magnitude of the capital that enters
into the process of production. This in turn is the basis of an extended scale
of production, of the methods for raising the productive power of labour that
accompany it, and of accelerated production of surplus-value. If, therefore, a
certain degree of accumulation of capital appears as a condition of the
specifically capitalist mode of production, the latter causes conversely an
accelerated accumulation of capital. With the accumulation of capital,
therefore, the specifically capitalistic mode of production develops, and with
the capitalist mode of production the accumulation of capital. Both these
economic factors bring about, in the compound ratio of the impulses they
reciprocally give one another, that change in the technical composition of
capital by which the variable constituent becomes always smaller and smaller as
compared with the constant. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Every individual capital is a larger or smaller
concentration of means of production, with a corresponding command over a
larger or smaller labour-army. Every accumulation becomes the means of new
accumulation. With the increasing mass of wealth which functions as capital,
accumulation increases the concentration of that wealth in the hands of
individual capitalists, and thereby widens the basis of production on a large
scale and of the specific methods of capitalist production. The growth of
social capital is effected by the growth of many individual capitals. All other
circumstances remaining the same, individual capitals, and with them the
concentration of the means of production, increase in such proportion as they
form aliquot parts of the total social capital. At the same time portions of
the original capitals disengage themselves and function as new independent
capitals. Besides other causes, the division of property, within capitalist
families, plays a great part in this. With the accumulation of capital,
therefore, the number of capitalists grows to a greater or less extent. Two
points characterise this kind of concentration which grows directly out of, or
rather is identical with, accumulation. First: The increasing concentration of
the social means of production in the hands of individual capitalists is, other
things remaining equal, limited by the degree of increase of social wealth.
Second: The part of social capital domiciled in each particular sphere of
production is divided among many capitalists who face one another as
independent commodity-producers competing with each other. Accumulation and the
concentration accompanying it are, therefore, not only scattered over many
points, but the increase of each functioning capital is thwarted by the formation
of new and the sub-division of old capitals. Accumulation, therefore, presents
itself on the one hand as increasing concentration of the means of production,
and of the command over labour; on the other, as repulsion of many individual
capitals one from another. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This splitting-up of the total social capital
into many individual capitals or the repulsion of its fractions one from
another, is counteracted by their attraction. This last does not mean that
simple concentration of the means of production and of the command over labour,
which is identical with accumulation. It is concentration of capitals already
formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of
capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals.
This process differs from the former in this, that it only presupposes a change
in the distribution of capital already to hand, and functioning; its field of
action is therefore not limited by the absolute growth of social wealth, by the
absolute limits of accumulation. Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a
single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. This is
centralisation proper, as distinct from accumulation and concentration. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The laws of this centralisation of capitals, or
of the attraction of capital by capital, cannot be developed here. A brief hint
at a few facts must suffice. The battle of competition is fought by cheapening
of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, <i class="calibre4">caeteris paribus,</i>
on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production.
Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered
that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an
increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a
business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd
into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or
incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages in direct proportion to the
number, and in inverse proportion to the magnitudes, of the antagonistic
capitals. It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals
partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish. Apart from this,
with capitalist production an altogether new force comes into play – the credit
system, which in its first stages furtively creeps in as the humble assistant
of accumulation, drawing into the hands of individual or associated
capitalists, by invisible threads, the money resources which lie scattered,
over the surface of society, in larger or smaller amounts; but it soon becomes
a new and terrible weapon in the battle of competition and is finally
transformed into an enormous social mechanism for the centralisation of capitals.
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Commensurately with the development of
capitalist production and accumulation there develop the two most powerful
levers of centralisation – competition and credit. At the same time the
progress of accumulation increases the material amenable to centralisation, <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>.,
the individual capitals, whilst the expansion of capitalist production creates,
on the one hand, the social want, and, on the other, the technical means
necessary for those immense industrial undertakings which require a previous
centralisation of capital for their accomplishment. Today, therefore, the force
of attraction, drawing together individual capitals, and the tendency to
centralisation are stronger than ever before. But if the relative extension and
energy of the movement towards centralisation is determined, in a certain
degree, by the magnitude of capitalist wealth and superiority of economic
mechanism already attained, progress in centralisation does not in any way
depend upon a positive growth in the magnitude of social capital. And this is
the specific difference between centralisation and concentration, the latter
being only another name for reproduction on an extended scale. Centralisation
may result from a mere change in the distribution of capitals already existing,
from a simple alteration in the quantitative grouping of the component parts of
social capital. Here capital can grow into powerful masses in a single hand
because there it has been withdrawn from many individual hands. In any given
branch of industry centralisation would reach its extreme limit if all the
individual capitals invested in it were fused into a single capital.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn897" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref897"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a> In a given society the limit would be
reached only when the entire social capital was united in the hands of either a
single capitalist or a single capitalist company. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Centralisation completes the work of
accumulation by enabling industrial capitalists to extend the scale of their
operations. Whether this latter result is the consequence of accumulation or
centralisation, whether centralisation is accomplished by the violent method of
annexation – when certain capitals become such preponderant centres of
attraction for others that they shatter the individual cohesion of the latter
and then draw the separate fragments to themselves – or whether the fusion of a
number of capitals already formed or in process of formation takes place by the
smoother process of organising joint-stock companies – the economic effect
remains the same. Everywhere the increased scale of industrial establishments
is the starting point for a more comprehensive organisation of the collective
work of many, for a wider development of their material motive forces – in
other words, for the progressive transformation of isolated processes of
production, carried on by customary methods, into processes of production
socially combined and scientifically arranged. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But accumulation, the gradual increase of
capital by reproduction as it passes from the circular to the spiral form, is
clearly a very slow procedure compared with centralisation, which has only to
change the quantitative groupings of the constituent parts of social capital.
The world would still be without railways if it had had to wait until
accumulation had got a few individual capitals far enough to be adequate for the
construction of a railway. Centralisation, on the contrary, accomplished this
in the twinkling of an eye, by means of joint-stock companies. And whilst
centralisation thus intensifies and accelerates the effects of accumulation, it
simultaneously extends and speeds those revolutions in the technical
composition of capital which raise its constant portion at the expense of its
variable portion, thus diminishing the relative demand for labour. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The masses of capital fused together overnight
by centralisation reproduce and multiply as the others do, only more rapidly,
thereby becoming new and powerful levers in social accumulation. Therefore,
when we speak of the progress of social accumulation we tacitly include – today
– the effects of centralisation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The additional capitals formed in the normal
course of accumulation (see Chapter XXIV, Section 1) serve particularly as
vehicles for the exploitation of new inventions and discoveries, and industrial
improvements in general. But in time the old capital also reaches the moment of
renewal from top to toe, when it sheds its skin and is reborn like the others
in a perfected technical form, in which a smaller quantity of labour will
suffice to set in motion a larger quantity of machinery and raw materials. The
absolute reduction in the demand for labour which necessarily follows from this
is obviously so much the greater the higher the degree in which the capitals
undergoing this process of renewal are already massed together by virtue of the
centralisation movement. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the one hand, therefore, the additional
capital formed in the course of accumulation attracts fewer and fewer labourers
in proportion to its magnitude. On the other hand, the old capital periodically
reproduced with change of composition, repels more and more of the labourers
formerly employed by it. </span></p>

<h3 class="calibre23"><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="_Toc273516472"></a><a class="pcalibre calibre20 pcalibre1" id="__RefHeading__820_1418669237"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre20"></span><span class="calibre20"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">Section 3: Progressive Production of a Relative
surplus population or Industrial Reserve Army</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The accumulation of capital, though originally
appearing as its quantitative extension only, is effected, as we have seen,
under a progressive qualitative change in its composition, under a constant
increase of its constant, at the expense of its variable constituent.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn898" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref898"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">13</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The specifically capitalist mode of production,
the development of the productive power of labour corresponding to it, and the
change thence resulting in the organic composition of capital, do not merely
keep pace with the advance of accumulation, or with the growth of social
wealth. They develop at a much quicker rate, because mere accumulation, the
absolute increase of the total social capital, is accompanied by the
centralisation of the individual capitals of which that total is made up; and
because the change in the technological composition of the additional capital
goes hand in hand with a similar change in the technological composition of the
original capital. With the advance of accumulation, therefore, the proportion
of constant to variable capital changes. If it was originally say 1:1, it now
becomes successively 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 7:1, &amp;c., so that, as the capital
increases, instead of ½ of its total value, only 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8,
&amp;c., is transformed into labour-power, and, on the other hand, 2/3, 3/4,
4/5, 5/6, 7/8 into means of production. Since the demand for labour is determined
not by the amount of capital as a whole, but by its variable constituent alone,
that demand falls progressively with the increase of the total capital, instead
of, as previously assumed, rising in proportion to it. It falls relatively to
the magnitude of the total capital, and at an accelerated rate, as this
magnitude increases. With the growth of the total capital, its variable
constituent or the labour incorporated in it, also does increase, but in a
constantly diminishing proportion. The intermediate pauses are shortened, in
which accumulation works as simple extension of production, on a given
technical basis. It is not merely that an accelerated accumulation of total
capital, accelerated in a constantly growing progression, is needed to absorb
an additional number of labourers, or even, on account of the constant
metamorphosis of old capital, to keep employed those already functioning. In
its turn, this increasing accumulation and centralisation becomes a source of
new changes in the composition of capital, of a more accelerated diminution of
its variable, as compared with its constant constituent. This accelerated
relative diminution of the variable constituent, that goes along with the
accelerated increase of the total capital, and moves more rapidly than this
increase, takes the inverse form, at the other pole, of an apparently absolute
increase of the labouring population, an increase always moving more rapidly
than that of the variable capital or the means of employment. But in fact, it
is capitalistic accumulation itself that constantly produces, and produces in
the direct ratio of its own energy and extent, a relatively redundant
population of labourers, <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>., a population of greater extent than
suffices for the average needs of the self-expansion of capital, and therefore
a surplus population. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Considering the social capital in its totality,
the movement of its accumulation now causes periodical changes, affecting it
more or less as a whole, now distributes its various phases simultaneously over
the different spheres of production. In some spheres a change in the
composition of capital occurs without increase of its absolute magnitude, as a
consequence of simple centralisation; in others the absolute growth of capital
is connected with absolute diminution of its variable constituent, or of the
labour power absorbed by it; in others again, capital continues growing for a
time on its given technical basis, and attracts additional labour power in
proportion to its increase, while at other times it undergoes organic change,
and lessens its variable constituent; in all spheres, the increase of the
variable part of capital, and therefore of the number of labourers employed by
it, is always connected with violent fluctuations and transitory production of
surplus population, whether this takes the more striking form of the repulsion
of labourers already employed, or the less evident but not less real form of
the more difficult absorption of the additional labouring population through
the usual channels.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn899" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref899"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">14</span></a> With the
magnitude of social capital already functioning, and the degree of its
increase, with the extension of the scale of production, and the mass of the
labourers set in motion, with the development of the productiveness of their
labour, with the greater breadth and fulness of all sources of wealth, there is
also an extension of the scale on which greater attraction of labourers by
capital is accompanied by their greater repulsion; the rapidity of the change
in the organic composition of capital, and in its technical form increases, and
an increasing number of spheres of production becomes involved in this change,
now simultaneously, now alternately. The labouring population therefore
produces, along with the accumulation of capital produced by it, the means by which
it itself is made relatively superfluous, is turned into a relative surplus
population; and it does this to an always increasing extent.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn900" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref900"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">15</span></a> This is a law of population peculiar to
the capitalist mode of production; and in fact every special historic mode of
production has its own special laws of population, historically valid within
its limits and only in so far as man has not interfered with them. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But if a surplus labouring population is a
necessary product of accumulation or of the development of wealth on a
capitalist basis, this surplus population becomes, conversely, the lever of
capitalistic accumulation, nay, a condition of existence of the capitalist mode
of production. It forms a disposable industrial reserve army, that belongs to
capital quite as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost.
Independently of the limits of the actual increase of population, it creates,
for the changing needs of the self-expansion of capital, a mass of human
material always ready for exploitation. With accumulation, and the development
of the productiveness of labour that accompanies it, the power of sudden
expansion of capital grows also; it grows, not merely because the elasticity of
the capital already functioning increases, not merely because the absolute
wealth of society expands, of which capital only forms an elastic part, not
merely because credit, under every special stimulus, at once places an unusual
part of this wealth at the disposal of production in the form of additional
capital; it grows, also, because the technical conditions of the process of
production themselves – machinery, means of transport, &amp;c. – now admit of
the rapidest transformation of masses of surplus-product into additional means
of production. The mass of social wealth, overflowing with the advance of
accumulation, and transformable into additional capital, thrusts itself
frantically into old branches of production, whose market suddenly expands, or
into newly formed branches, such as railways, &amp;c., the need for which grows
out of the development of the old ones. In all such cases, there must be the
possibility of throwing great masses of men suddenly on the decisive points
without injury to the scale of production in other spheres. Overpopulation
supplies these masses. The course characteristic of modern industry, <i class="calibre4">viz</i>.,
a decennial cycle (interrupted by smaller oscillations), of periods of average
activity, production at high pressure, crisis and stagnation, depends on the
constant formation, the greater or less absorption, and the re-formation of the
industrial reserve army or surplus population. In their turn, the varying
phases of the industrial cycle recruit the surplus population, and become one
of the most energetic agents of its reproduction. This peculiar course of modern
industry, which occurs in no earlier period of human history, was also
impossible in the childhood of capitalist production. The composition of
capital changed but very slowly. With its accumulation, therefore, there kept
pace, on the whole, a corresponding growth in the demand for labour. Slow as
was the advance of accumulation compared with that of more modern times, it
found a check in the natural limits of the exploitable labouring population,
limits which could only be got rid of by forcible means to be mentioned later.
The expansion by fits and starts of the scale of production is the preliminary
to its equally sudden contraction; the latter again evokes the former, but the
former is impossible without disposable human material, without an increase, in
the number of labourers independently of the absolute growth of the population.
This increase is effected by the simple process that constantly “sets free” a
part of the labourers; by methods which lessen the number of labourers employed
in proportion to the increased production. The whole form of the movement of
modern industry depends, therefore, upon the constant transformation of a part
of the labouring population into unemployed or half-employed hands. The
superficiality of Political Economy shows itself in the fact that it looks upon
the expansion and contraction of credit, which is a mere symptom of the
periodic changes of the industrial cycle, as their cause. As the heavenly
bodies, once thrown into a certain definite motion, always repeat this, so is
it with social production as soon as it is once thrown into this movement of
alternate expansion and contraction. Effects, in their turn, become causes, and
the varying accidents of the whole process, which always reproduces its own
conditions, take on the form of periodicity. When this periodicity is once
consolidated, even Political Economy then sees that the production of a
relative surplus population – <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>., surplus with regard to the average
needs of the self-expansion of capital – is a necessary condition of modern
industry. </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Suppose,”
says H. Merivale, formerly Professor of Political Economy at Oxford,
subsequently employed in the English Colonial Office, “suppose that, on the
occasion of some of these crises, the nation were to rouse itself to the effort
of getting rid by emigration of some hundreds of thousands of superfluous arms,
what would be the consequence? That, at the first returning demand for labour,
there would be a deficiency. However rapid reproduction may be, it takes, at
all events, the space of a generation to replace the loss of adult labour. Now,
the profits of our manufacturers depend mainly on the power of making use of
the prosperous moment when demand is brisk, and thus compensating themselves
for the interval during which it is slack. This power is secured to them only
by the command of machinery and of manual labour. They must have hands ready by
them, they must be able to increase the activity of their operations when
required, and to slacken it again, according to the state of the market, or
they cannot possibly maintain that pre-eminence in the race of competition on
which the wealth of the country is founded.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn901" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref901"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">16</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Even Malthus recognises overpopulation as a
necessity of modern industry, though, after his narrow fashion, he explains it
by the absolute over-growth of the labouring population, not by their becoming
relatively supernumerary. He says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Prudential
habits with regard to marriage, carried to a considerable extent among the
labouring class of a country mainly depending upon manufactures and commerce,
might injure it.... From the nature of a population, an increase of labourers
cannot be brought into market in consequence of a particular demand till after
the lapse of 16 or 18 years, and the conversion of revenue into capital, by
saving, may take place much more rapidly: a country is always liable to an
increase in the quantity of the funds for the maintenance of labour faster than
the increase of population.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn902" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref902"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">17</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After Political Economy has thus demonstrated
the constant production of a relative surplus population of labourers to be a
necessity of capitalistic accumulation, she very aptly, in the guise of an old
maid, puts in the mouth of her “beau ideal” of a capitalist the following words
addressed to those supernumeraries thrown on the streets by their own creation
of additional capital: –</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“We
manufacturers do what we can for you, whilst we are increasing that capital on
which you must subsist, and you must do the rest by accommodating your numbers
to the means of subsistence.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn903" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref903"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">18</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Capitalist production can by no means content
itself with the quantity of disposable labour power which the natural increase
of population yields. It requires for its free play an industrial reserve army
independent of these natural limits. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Up to this point it has been assumed that the
increase or diminution of the variable capital corresponds rigidly with the
increase or diminution of the number of labourers employed. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The number of labourers commanded by capital may
remain the same, or even fall, while the variable capital increases. This is
the case if the individual labourer yields more labour, and therefore his wages
increase, and this although the price of labour remains the same or even falls,
only more slowly than the mass of labour rises. Increase of variable capital,
in this case, becomes an index of more labour, but not of more labourers
employed. It is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given
quantity of labour out of a smaller, rather than a greater number of labourers,
if the cost is about the same. In the latter case, the outlay of constant
capital increases in proportion to the mass of labour set in action; in the
former that increase is much smaller. The more extended the scale of
production, the stronger this motive. Its force increases with the accumulation
of capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We have seen that the development of the
capitalist mode of production and of the productive power of labour – at once
the cause and effect of accumulation – enables the capitalist, with the same
outlay of variable capital, to set in action more labour by greater
exploitation (extensive or intensive) of each individual labour power. We have
further seen that the capitalist buys with the same capital a greater mass of
labour power, as he progressively replaces skilled labourers by less skilled,
mature labour power by immature, male by female, that of adults by that of
young persons or children. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the one hand, therefore, with the progress of
accumulation, a larger variable capital sets more labour in action without
enlisting more labourers; on the other, a variable capital of the same
magnitude sets in action more labour with the same mass of labour power; and,
finally, a greater number of inferior labour powers by displacement of higher. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The production of a relative surplus population,
or the setting free of labourers, goes on therefore yet more rapidly than the
technical revolution of the process of production that accompanies, and is
accelerated by, the advance of accumulation; and more rapidly than the
corresponding diminution of the variable part of capital as compared with the
constant. If the means of production, as they increase in extent and effective
power, become to a less extent means of employment of labourers, this state of
things is again modified by the fact that in proportion as the productiveness
of labour increases, capital increases its supply of labour more quickly than
its demand for labourers. The overwork of the employed part of the working
class swells the ranks of the reserve, whilst conversely the greater pressure
that the latter by its competition exerts on the former, forces these to submit
to overwork and to subjugation under the dictates of capital. The condemnation
of one part of the working class to enforced idleness by the overwork of the
other part, and the converse, becomes a means of enriching the individual
capitalists,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn904" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref904"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">19</span></a> and accelerates at the
same time the production of the industrial reserve army on a scale
corresponding with the advance of social accumulation. How important is this
element in the formation of the relative surplus population, is shown by the
example of England. Her technical means for saving labour are colossal.
Nevertheless, if to-morrow morning labour generally were reduced to a rational amount,
and proportioned to the different sections of the working class according to
age and sex, the working population to hand would be absolutely insufficient
for the carrying on of national production on its present scale. The great
majority of the labourers now “unproductive” would have to be turned into
“productive” ones. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Taking them as a whole, the general movements of
wages are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the
industrial reserve army, and these again correspond to the periodic changes of
the industrial cycle. They are, therefore, not determined by the variations of
the absolute number of the working population, but by the varying proportions
in which the working class is divided into active and reserve army, by the increase
or diminution in the relative amount of the surplus population, by the extent
to which it is now absorbed, now set free. For Modern Industry with its
decennial cycles and periodic phases, which, moreover, as accumulation
advances, are complicated by irregular oscillations following each other more
and more quickly, that would indeed be a beautiful law, which pretends to make
the action of capital dependent on the absolute variation of the population,
instead of regulating the demand and supply of labour by the alternate
expansion and contraction of capital, the labour-market now appearing
relatively under-full, because capital is expanding, now again over-full,
because it is contracting. Yet this is the dogma of the economists. According
to them, wages rise in consequence of accumulation of capital. The higher wages
stimulate the working population to more rapid multiplication, and this goes on
until the labour-market becomes too full, and therefore capital, relatively to
the supply of labour, becomes insufficient. Wages fall, and now we have the
reverse of the medal. The working population is little by little decimated as
the result of the fall in wages, so that capital is again in excess relatively
to them, or, as others explain it, falling wages and the corresponding increase
in the exploitation of the labourer again accelerates accumulation, whilst, at
the same time, the lower wages hold the increase of the working class in check.
Then comes again the time, when the supply of labour is less than the demand,
wages rise, and so on. A beautiful mode of motion this for developed capitalist
production! Before, in consequence of the rise of wages, any positive increase
of the population really fit for work could occur, the time would have been
passed again and again, during which the industrial campaign must have been
carried through, the battle fought and won. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Between 1849 and 1859, a rise of wages
practically insignificant, though accompanied by falling prices of corn, took
place in the English agricultural districts. In Wiltshire, <i class="calibre4">e.g</i>., the
weekly wages rose from 7s. to 8s.; in Dorsetshire from 7s. or 8s., to 9s.,
&amp;c. This was the result of an unusual exodus of the agricultural surplus
population caused by the demands of war, the vast extension of railroads,
factories, mines, &amp;c. The lower the wages, the higher is the proportion in
which ever so insignificant a rise of them expresses itself. If the weekly
wage, <i class="calibre4">e.g</i>., is 20s. and it rises to 22s., that is a rise of 10 per
cent.; but if it is only 7s. and it rises to 9s., that is a rise of 28 4/7 per
cent., which sounds very fine. Everywhere the farmers were howling, and the
London <i class="calibre4">Economist,</i> with reference to these starvation-wages, prattled
quite seriously of “a general and substantial advance.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn905" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref905"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">20</span></a> What did the farmers do now? Did they
wait until, in consequence of this brilliant remuneration, the agricultural
labourers had so increased and multiplied that their wages must fall again, as
prescribed by the dogmatic economic brain? They introduced more machinery, and
in a moment the labourers were redundant again in a proportion satisfactory
even to the farmers. There was now “more capital” laid out in agriculture than
before, and in a more productive form. With this the demand for labour fell,
not only relatively, but absolutely. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The above economic fiction confuses the laws
that regulate the general movement of wages, or the ratio between the working
class – <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>., the total labour power – and the total social capital,
with the laws that distribute the working population over the different spheres
of production. If, <i class="calibre4">e.g.,</i> in consequence of favourable circumstances,
accumulation in a particular sphere of production becomes especially active,
and profits in it, being greater than the average profits, attract additional
capital, of course the demand for labour rises and wages also rise. The higher
wages draw a larger part of the working population into the more favoured
sphere, until it is glutted with labour power, and wages at length fall again
to their average level or below it, if the pressure is too great. Then, not
only does the immigration of labourers into the branch of industry in question
cease; it gives place to their emigration. Here the political economist thinks
he sees the why and wherefore of an absolute increase of workers accompanying
an increase of wages, and of a diminution of wages accompanying an absolute
increase of labourers. But he sees really only the local oscillation of the
labour-market in a particular sphere of production – he sees only the phenomena
accompanying the distribution of the working population into the different
spheres of outlay of capital, according to its varying needs. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The industrial reserve army, during the periods
of stagnation and average prosperity, weighs down the active labour-army;
during the periods of over-production and paroxysm, it holds its pretensions in
check. Relative surplus population is therefore the pivot upon which the law of
demand and supply of labour works. It confines the field of action of this law
within the limits absolutely convenient to the activity of exploitation and to
the domination of capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This is the place to return to one of the grand
exploits of economic apologetics. It will be remembered that if through the
introduction of new, or the extension of old, machinery, a portion of variable
capital is transformed into constant, the economic apologist interprets this
operation which “fixes” capital and by that very act sets labourers “free,” in
exactly the opposite way, pretending that it sets free capital for the
labourers. Only now can one fully understand the effrontery of these
apologists. What are set free are not only the labourers immediately turned out
by the machines, but also their future substitutes in the rising generation,
and the additional contingent, that with the usual extension of trade on the
old basis would be regularly absorbed. They are now all “set free,” and every
new bit of capital looking out for employment can dispose of them. Whether it
attracts them or others, the effect on the general labour demand will be nil,
if this capital is just sufficient to take out of the market as many labourers
as the machines threw upon it. If it employs a smaller number, that of the
supernumeraries increases; if it employs a greater, the general demand for
labour only increases to the extent of the excess of the employed over those
“set free.” The impulse that additional capital, seeking an outlet, would
otherwise have given to the general demand for labour, is therefore in every
case neutralised to the extent of the labourers thrown out of employment by the
machine. That is to say, the mechanism of capitalistic production so manages
matters that the absolute increase of capital is accompanied by no
corresponding rise in the general demand for labour. And this the apologist
calls a compensation for the misery, the sufferings, the possible death of the
displaced labourers during the transition period that banishes them into the
industrial reserve army! The demand for labour is not identical with increase
of capital, nor supply of labour with increase of the working class. It is not
a case of two independent forces working on one another. Les dés sont pipés.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="599a"></a><span lang="EN-GB">Capital works on both
sides at the same time. If its accumulation, on the one hand, increases the
demand for labour, it increases on the other the supply of labourers by the
“setting free” of them, whilst at the same time the pressure of the unemployed
compels those that are employed to furnish more labour, and therefore makes the
supply of labour, to a certain extent, independent of the supply of labourers.
The action of the law of supply and demand of labour on this basis completes
the despotism of capital. As soon, therefore, as the labourers learn the
secret, how it comes to pass that in the same measure as they work more, as
they produce more wealth for others, and as the productive power of their
labour increases, so in the same measure even their function as a means of the
self-expansion of capital becomes more and more precarious for them; as soon as
they discover that the degree of intensity of the competition among themselves
depends wholly on the pressure of the relative surplus population; as soon as,
by Trades’ Unions, &amp;c., they try to organise a regular co-operation between
employed and unemployed in order to destroy or to weaken the ruinous effects of
this natural law of capitalistic production on their class, so soon capital and
its sycophant, Political Economy, cry out at the infringement of the “eternal”
and so to say “sacred” law of supply and demand. Every combination of employed
and unemployed disturbs the “harmonious” action of this law. But, on the other
hand, as soon as (in the colonies, <i class="calibre4">e.g</i>.) adverse circumstances prevent
the creation of an industrial reserve army and, with it, the absolute
dependence of the working class upon the capitalist class, capital, along with
its commonplace Sancho Panza, rebels against the “sacred” law of supply and
demand, and tries to check its inconvenient action by forcible means and State interference.</span></p>

surplus population. The General Law of Capitalistic Accumulation</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20"></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The relative surplus population exists in every
possible form. Every labourer belongs to it during the time when he is only
partially employed or wholly unemployed. Not taking into account the great
periodically recurring forms that the changing phases of the industrial cycle
impress on it, now an acute form during the crisis, then again a chronic form
during dull times – it has always three forms, the floating, the latent, the
stagnant. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the centres of modern industry – factories,
manufactures, ironworks, mines, &amp;c. – the labourers are sometimes repelled,
sometimes attracted again in greater masses, the number of those employed
increasing on the whole, although in a constantly decreasing proportion to the
scale of production. Here the surplus population exists in the floating form. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the automatic factories, as in all the great
workshops, where machinery enters as a factor, or where only the modern
division of labour is carried out, large numbers of boys are employed up to the
age of maturity. When this term is once reached, only a very small number
continue to find employment in the same branches of industry, whilst the
majority are regularly discharged. This majority forms an element of the
floating surplus population, growing with the extension of those branches of
industry. Part of them emigrates, following in fact capital that has emigrated.
One consequence is that the female population grows more rapidly than the male,
<i class="calibre4">teste</i> England. That the natural increase of the number of labourers does
not satisfy the requirements of the accumulation of capital, and yet all the
time is in excess of them, is a contradiction inherent to the movement of
capital itself. It wants larger numbers of youthful labourers, a smaller number
of adults. The contradiction is not more glaring than that other one that there
is a complaint of the want of hands, while at the same time many thousands are
out of work, because the division of labour chains them to a particular branch
of industry.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn906" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref906"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">21</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The consumption of labour power by capital is,
besides, so rapid that the labourer, half-way through his life, has already
more or less completely lived himself out. He falls into the ranks of the
supernumeraries, or is thrust down from a higher to a lower step in the scale.
It is precisely among the work-people of modern industry that we meet with the
shortest duration of life. Dr. Lee, Medical Officer of Health for Manchester,
stated</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“that the
average age at death of the Manchester ... upper middle class was 38 years,
while the average age at death of the labouring class was 17; while at
Liverpool those figures were represented as 35 against 15. It thus appeared
that the well-to-do classes had a lease of life which was more than double the
value of that which fell to the lot of the less favoured citizens.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn907" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref907"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">22</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In order to conform to these circumstances, the
absolute increase of this section of the proletariat must take place under
conditions that shall swell their numbers, although the individual elements are
used up rapidly. Hence, rapid renewal of the generations of labourers (this law
does not hold for the other classes of the population). This social need is met
by early marriages, a necessary consequence of the conditions in which the
labourers of modern industry live, and by the premium that the exploitation of
children sets on their production. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As soon as capitalist production takes
possession of agriculture, and in proportion to the extent to which it does so,
the demand for an agricultural labouring population falls absolutely, while the
accumulation of the capital employed in agriculture advances, without this
repulsion being, as in non-agricultural industries, compensated by a greater
attraction. Part of the agricultural population is therefore constantly on the
point of passing over into an urban or manufacturing proletariat, and on the
look-out for circumstances favourable to this transformation. (Manufacture is
used here in the sense of all non-agricultural industries.)<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn908" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref908"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">23</span></a> This source of relative surplus
population is thus constantly flowing. But the constant flow towards the towns
pre-supposes, in the country itself, a constant latent surplus population, the
extent of which becomes evident only when its channels of outlet open to
exceptional width. The agricultural labourer is therefore reduced to the
minimum of wages, and always stands with one foot already in the swamp of
pauperism. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The third category of the relative surplus
population, the stagnant, forms a part of the active labour army, but with
extremely irregular employment. Hence it furnishes to capital an inexhaustible
reservoir of disposable labour power. Its conditions of life sink below the
average normal level of the working class; this makes it at once the broad
basis of special branches of capitalist exploitation. It is characterised by
maximum of working-time, and minimum of wages. We have learnt to know its chief
form under the rubric of “domestic industry.” It recruits itself constantly
from the supernumerary forces of modern industry and agriculture, and specially
from those decaying branches of industry where handicraft is yielding to
manufacture, manufacture to machinery. Its extent grows, as with the extent and
energy of accumulation, the creation of a surplus population advances. But it
forms at the same time a self-reproducing and self-perpetuating element of the
working class, taking a proportionally greater part in the general increase of
that class than the other elements. In fact, not only the number of births and
deaths, but the absolute size of the families stand in inverse proportion to
the height of wages, and therefore to the amount of means of subsistence of
which the different categories of labourers dispose. This law of capitalistic
society would sound absurd to savages, or even civilised colonists. It calls to
mind the boundless reproduction of animals individually weak and constantly
hunted down.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn909" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref909"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">24</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The lowest sediment of the relative surplus
population finally dwells in the sphere of pauperism. Exclusive of vagabonds,
criminals, prostitutes, in a word, the “dangerous” classes, this layer of
society consists of three categories. First, those able to work. One need only
glance superficially at the statistics of English pauperism to find that the
quantity of paupers increases with every crisis, and diminishes with every
revival of trade. Second, orphans and pauper children. These are candidates for
the industrial reserve army, and are, in times of great prosperity, as 1860, <i class="calibre4">e.g</i>.,
speedily and in large numbers enrolled in the active army of labourers. Third,
the demoralised and ragged, and those unable to work, chiefly people who
succumb to their incapacity for adaptation, due to the division of labour;
people who have passed the normal age of the labourer; the victims of industry,
whose number increases with the increase of dangerous machinery, of mines,
chemical works, &amp;c., the mutilated, the sickly, the widows, &amp;c.
Pauperism is the hospital of the active labour-army and the dead weight of the
industrial reserve army. Its production is included in that of the relative
surplus population, its necessity in theirs; along with the surplus population,
pauperism forms a condition of capitalist production, and of the capitalist
development of wealth. It enters into the <i class="calibre4">faux frais</i> of capitalist
production; but capital knows how to throw these, for the most part, from its
own shoulders on to those of the working class and the lower middle class. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The greater the social wealth, the functioning
capital, the extent and energy of its growth, and, therefore, also the absolute
mass of the proletariat and the productiveness of its labour, the greater is
the industrial reserve army. The same causes which develop the expansive power
of capital, develop also the labour power at its disposal. The relative mass of
the industrial reserve army increases therefore with the potential energy of
wealth. But the greater this reserve army in proportion to the active labour
army, the greater is the mass of a consolidated surplus population, whose
misery is in inverse ratio to its torment of labour. The more extensive,
finally, the lazarus layers of the working class, and the industrial reserve
army, the greater is official pauperism. <i class="calibre4">This is the absolute general law of
capitalist accumulation. </i>Like all other laws it is modified in its working
by many circumstances, the analysis of which does not concern us here. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The folly is now patent of the economic wisdom
that preaches to the labourers the accommodation of their number to the
requirements of capital. The mechanism of capitalist production and
accumulation constantly effects this adjustment. The first word of this
adaptation is the creation of a relative surplus population, or industrial
reserve army. Its last word is the misery of constantly extending strata of the
active army of labour, and the dead weight of pauperism. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The law by which a constantly increasing
quantity of means of production, thanks to the advance in the productiveness of
social labour, may be set in movement by a progressively diminishing
expenditure of human power, this law, in a capitalist society – where the
labourer does not employ the means of production, but the means of production
employ the labourer – undergoes a complete inversion and is expressed thus: the
higher the productiveness of labour, the greater is the pressure of the
labourers on the means of employment, the more precarious, therefore, becomes
their condition of existence, <i class="calibre4">viz</i>., the sale of their own labour power
for the increasing of another’s wealth, or for the self-expansion of capital.
The fact that the means of production, and the productiveness of labour,
increase more rapidly than the productive population, expresses itself, therefore,
capitalistically in the inverse form that the labouring population always
increases more rapidly than the conditions under which capital can employ this
increase for its own self-expansion. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We saw in Part IV., when analysing the
production of relative surplus-value: within the capitalist system all methods
for raising the social productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost
of the individual labourer; all means for the development of production
transform themselves into means of domination over, and exploitation of, the
producers; they mutilate the labourer into a fragment of a man, degrade him to
the level of an appendage of a machine, destroy every remnant of charm in his
work and turn it into a hated toil; they estrange from him the intellectual
potentialities of the labour process in the same proportion as science is
incorporated in it as an independent power; they distort the conditions under
which he works, subject him during the labour process to a despotism the more
hateful for its meanness; they transform his life-time into working-time, and
drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of capital. But
all methods for the production of surplus-value are at the same time methods of
accumulation; and every extension of accumulation becomes again a means for the
development of those methods. It follows therefore that in proportion as
capital accumulates, the lot of the labourer, be his payment high or low, must
grow worse. The law, finally, that always equilibrates the relative surplus
population, or industrial reserve army, to the extent and energy of
accumulation, this law rivets the labourer to capital more firmly than the
wedges of Vulcan did Prometheus to the rock. It establishes an accumulation of
misery, corresponding with accumulation of capital. Accumulation of wealth at
one pole is, therefore, at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil
slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole, <i class="calibre4">i.e.,</i>
on the side of the class that produces its own product in the form of capital.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn910" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref910"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">25</span></a> This antagonistic character of
capitalistic accumulation is enunciated in various forms by political
economists, although by them it is confounded with phenomena, certainly to some
extent analogous, but nevertheless essentially distinct, and belonging to
pre-capitalistic modes of production. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Venetian monk Ortes, one of the great
economic writers of the 18th century, regards the antagonism of capitalist
production as a general natural law of social wealth.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“In the
economy of a nation, advantages and evils always balance one another (</span><span lang="IT">il bene ed il male economico in una
nazione sempre all, istessa misura</span><span lang="EN-GB">): the abundance of wealth with some people, is always equal to the want
of it with others (</span><span lang="IT">la copia
dei beni in alcuni sempre eguale alia mancanza di essi in altri</span><span lang="EN-GB">): the great riches of a small
number are always accompanied by the absolute privation of the first
necessaries of life for many others. The wealth of a nation corresponds with
its population, and its misery corresponds with its wealth. Diligence in some
compels idleness in others. The poor and idle are a necessary consequence of
the rich and active,” &amp;c.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn911" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref911"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">26</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In a thoroughly brutal way about 10 years after
Ortes, the Church of England parson, Townsend, glorified misery as a necessary
condition of wealth.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Legal
constraint (to labour) is attended with too much trouble, violence, and noise,
whereas hunger is not only a peaceable, silent, unremitted pressure, but as the
most natural motive to industry and labour, it calls forth the most powerful
exertions.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Everything therefore depends upon making hunger
permanent among the working class, and for this, according to Townsend, the
principle of population, especially active among the poor, provides.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“It seems to
be a law of Nature that the poor should be to a certain degree improvident” [<i class="calibre4">i.e</i>.,
so improvident as to be born <i class="calibre4">without</i> a silver spoon in the mouth], “that
there may always be some to fulfil the most servile, the most sordid, and the
most ignoble offices in the community. The stock of human happiness is thereby
much increased, whilst the more delicate are not only relieved from drudgery
... but are left at liberty without interruption to pursue those callings which
are suited to their various dispositions ... it” [the Poor Law] “tends to
destroy the harmony and beauty, the symmetry and order of that system which God
and Nature have established in the world.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn912" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref912"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">27</span></a>
If the Venetian monk found in the fatal destiny that makes misery eternal, the <i class="calibre4">raison
d’être</i> of Christian charity, celibacy, monasteries and holy houses, the
Protestant prebendary finds in it a pretext for condemning the laws in virtue
of which the poor possessed a right to a miserable public relief. </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The progress
of social wealth,” says Storch, “begets this useful class of society ... which
performs the most wearisome, the vilest, the most disgusting functions, which
takes, in a word, on its shoulders all that is disagreeable and servile in
life, and procures thus for other classes leisure, serenity of mind and
conventional” [c’est bon!] “dignity of character.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn913" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref913"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">28</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Storch asks himself in what then really consists
the progress of this capitalistic civilisation with its misery and its
degradation of the masses, as compared with barbarism. He finds but one answer:
security! </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Thanks to
the advance of industry and science,” says Sismondi, “every labourer can
produce every day much more than his consumption requires. But at the same
time, whilst his labour produces wealth, that wealth would, were he called on
to consume it himself, make him less fit for labour.” According to him, “men” [<i class="calibre4">i.e</i>.,
non-workers] “would probably prefer to do without all artistic perfection, and
all the enjoyments that manufacturers procure for us, if it were necessary that
all should buy them by constant toil like that of the labourer.... Exertion
today is separated from its recompense; it is not the same man that first
works, and then reposes; but it is because the one works that the other
rests.... The indefinite multiplication of the productive powers of labour can
then only have for result the increase of luxury and enjoyment of the idle
rich.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn914" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref914"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">29</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Finally Destutt de Tracy, the fish-blooded
