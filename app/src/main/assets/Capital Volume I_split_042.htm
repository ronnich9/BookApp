<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">No period of modern society is so favourable for
the study of capitalist accumulation as the period of the last 20 years. It is
as if this period had found Fortunatus’ purse. But of all countries England
again furnishes the classical example, because it holds the foremost place in
the world-market, because capitalist production is here alone completely
developed, and lastly, because the introduction of the Free-trade millennium
since 1846 has cut off the last retreat of vulgar economy. The titanic advance
of production – the latter half of the 20 years’ period again far surpassing
the former – has been already pointed out sufficiently in Part IV. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although the absolute increase of the English
population in the last half century was very great, the relative increase or
rate of growth fell constantly, as the following table borrowed from the census
shows. </span></p>

increase of wealth. Here the movement of profit, rent of land, &amp;c., that
come under the income tax, furnishes the surest basis. The increase of profits
liable to income tax (farmers and some other categories not included) in Great
Britain from 1853 to 1864 amounted to 50.47% or 4.58% as the annual average,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn916" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref916"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">31</span></a> that of the population during the same

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If we compare the years from 1853 to 1864 in
three sets of four consecutive years each, the rate of augmentation of the
income increases constantly.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn917" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref917"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">32</span></a> It is, <i class="calibre4">e.g.,</i>
for that arising from profits between 1853 to 1857, 1.73% yearly; 1857-1861,
2.74%, and for 1861-64, 9.30% yearly. The sum of the incomes of the United
Kingdom that come under the income tax was in 1856, £307,068,898; in 1859,
£328,127,416; in 1862, £351,745,241; in 1863, £359,142,897; in 1864, £362,462,279;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The accumulation of capital was attended at the
same time by its concentration and centralisation. Although no official
statistics of agriculture existed for England (they did for Ireland), they were
voluntarily given in 10 counties. These statistics gave the result that from
1851 to 1861 the number of farms of less than 100 acres had fallen from 31,583
to 26,597, so that 5,016 had been thrown together into larger farms.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn919" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref919"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">34</span></a> From 1815 to 1825 no personal estate of
more than £1,000,000 came under the succession duty; from 1825 to 1855,
however, 8 did; and 4 from 1856 to June, 1859, <i class="calibre4">i.e.,</i> in 4½ years.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn920" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref920"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">35</span></a> The centralisation will, however, be best
seen from a short analysis of the Income Tax Schedule D (profits, exclusive of
farms, &amp;c.), in the years 1864 and 1865. I note beforehand that incomes
from this source pay income tax on everything over £60. These incomes liable to
taxation in England, Wales and Scotland, amounted in 1864 to £95,844,222, in
1865 to £105,435,579.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn921" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref921"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">36</span></a> The number

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us turn now to the direct agents of this
industry, or the producers of this wealth, to the working class.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“It is one of
the most melancholy features in the social state of this country,” says
Gladstone, “that while there was a decrease in the consuming powers of the
people, and while there was an increase in the privations and distress of the
labouring class and operatives, there was at the same time a constant
accumulation of wealth in the upper classes, and a constant increase of
capital.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn924" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref924"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">39</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thus spake this unctuous minister in the House
of Commons of February 13th, 1843. On April 16th, 1863, 20 years later, in the
speech in which he introduced his Budget:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“From 1842 to
1852 the taxable income of the country increased by 6 per cent.... In the 8
years from 1853 to 1861 it had increased from the basis taken in 1853 by 20 per
cent.! The fact is so astonishing as to be almost incredible ... this
intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power ... entirely confined to classes
of property ... must be of indirect benefit to the labouring population,
because it cheapens the commodities of general consumption. While the rich have
been growing richer, the poor have been growing less poor. At any rate, whether
the extremes of poverty are less, I do not presume to say.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn925" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref925"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">40</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">How lame an anti-climax! If the working class
has remained “poor,” only “less poor” in proportion as it produces for the
wealthy class “an intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power,” then it has
remained relatively just as poor. If the extremes of poverty have not lessened,
they have increased, because the extremes of wealth have. As to the cheapening
of the means of subsistence, the official statistics, <i class="calibre4">e.g.,</i> the accounts
of the London Orphan Asylum, show an increase in price of 20% for the average
of the three years 1860-1862, compared with 1851-1853. In the following three
years, 1863-1865, there was a progressive rise in the price of meat, butter,
milk, sugar, salt, coals, and a number of other necessary means of subsistence.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn926" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref926"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">41</span></a><span> 
</span>Gladstone’s next Budget speech of April 7th, 1864, is a Pindaric
dithyrambus on the advance of surplus-value-making and the happiness of the
people “tempered by poverty.” He speaks of masses “on the border” of pauperism,
of branches of trade in which “wages have not increased,” and finally sums up
the happiness of the working class in the words:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“human life

roundly:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“I do not, of
course, deny that money wages have been augmented by this increase of capital
(in the last ten years), but this apparent advantage is to a great extent lost,
because many of the necessaries of life are becoming dearer” (he believes
because of the fall in value of the precious metals)..."the rich grow
rapidly richer, whilst there is no perceptible advance in the comfort enjoyed
by the industrial classes.... They (the labourers) become almost the slaves of
the tradesman, to whom they owe money.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn928" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref928"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">43</span></a>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the chapters on the “working day” and
“machinery,” the reader has seen under what circumstances the British working
class created an “intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power” for the
propertied classes. There we were chiefly concerned with the social functioning
of the labourer. But for a full elucidation of the law of accumulation, his
condition outside the workshop must also be looked at, his condition as to food
and dwelling. The limits of this book compel us to concern ourselves chiefly
with the worst paid part of the industrial proletariat, and with the
agricultural labourers, who together form the majority of the working class. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But first, one word on official pauperism, or on
that part of the working class which has forfeited its condition of existence
(the sale of labour power), and vegetates upon public alms. The official list
of paupers numbered in England<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn929" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref929"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">44</span></a> 851,369
persons; in 1856, 877,767; in 1865, 971,433. In consequence of the cotton
famine, it grew in the years 1863 and 1864 to 1,079,382 and 1,014,978. The
crisis of 1866, which fell most heavily on London, created in this centre of
the world market, more populous than the kingdom of Scotland, an increase of
pauperism for the year 1866 of 19.5% compared with 1865, and of 24.4% compared
with 1864, and a still greater increase for the first months of 1867 as
compared with 1866. From the analysis of the statistics of pauperism, two
points are to be taken. On the one hand, the fluctuation up and down of the
number of paupers, reflects the periodic changes of the industrial cycle. On
the other, the official statistics become more and more misleading as to the
actual extent of pauperism in proportion as, with the accumulation of capital,
the class-struggle, and, therefore, the class consciousness of the working men,
develop. <i class="calibre4">E.g</i>., the barbarity in the treatment of the paupers, at which
the English Press (<i class="calibre4">The Times, Pall Mall Gazette,</i> etc.) have cried out so
loudly during the last two years, is of ancient date. F. Engels showed in 1844
exactly the same horrors, exactly the same transient canting outcries of
“sensational literature.” But frightful increase of “deaths by starvation” in
London during the last ten years proves beyond doubt the growing horror in
which the working-people hold the slavery of the workhouse, that place of
punishment for misery.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn930" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref930"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">45</span></a> </span></p>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">B. The Badly Paid Strata of the British Industrial
Class</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">During the cotton famine of 1862, Dr. Smith was
charged by the Privy Council with an inquiry into the conditions of nourishment
of the distressed operatives in Lancashire and Cheshire. His observations
during many preceding years had led him to the conclusion that “to avert
starvation diseases,” the daily food of an average woman ought to contain at
least 3,900 grains of carbon with 180 grains of nitrogen; the daily food of an
average man, at least 4,300 grains of carbon with 200 grains of nitrogen; for
women, about the same quantity of nutritive elements as are contained in 2 lbs.
of good wheaten bread, for men 1/9 more; for the weekly average of adult men
and women, at least 28,600 grains of carbon and 1,330 grains of nitrogen. His
calculation was practically confirmed in a surprising manner by its agreement
with the miserable quantity of nourishment to which want had forced down the
consumption of the cotton operatives. This was, in December, 1862, 29,211
grains of carbon, and 1,295 grains of nitrogen weekly. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the year 1863, the Privy Council ordered an
inquiry into the state of distress of the worst-nourished part of the English
working class. Dr. Simon, medical officer to the Privy Council, chose for this
work the above-mentioned Dr. Smith. His inquiry ranges on the one hand over the
agricultural labourers, on the other, over silk-weavers, needlewomen,
kid-glovers, stocking-weavers, glove-weavers, and shoemakers. The latter
categories are, with the exception of the stocking-weavers, exclusively
town-dwellers. It was made a rule in the inquiry to select in each category the
most healthy families, and those comparatively in the best circumstances. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As a general result it was found that</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“in only one
of the examined classes of in-door operatives did the average nitrogen supply
just exceed, while in another it nearly reached, the estimated standard of bare
sufficiency [<i class="calibre4">i.e</i>., sufficient to avert starvation diseases], and that in
two classes there was defect – in one, a very large defect – of both nitrogen
and carbon. Moreover, as regards the examined families of the agricultural
population, it appeared that more than a fifth were with less than the
estimated sufficiency of carbonaceous food, that more than one-third were with
less than the estimated sufficiency of nitrogenous food, and that in three
counties (Berkshire, Oxfordshire, and Somersetshire), insufficiency of
nitrogenous food was the average local diet.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn931" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref931"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">46</span></a>

Health Report says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“That cases
are innumerable in which defective diet is the cause or the aggravator of
disease, can be affirmed by any one who is conversant with poor law medical
practice, or with the wards and out-patient rooms of hospitals.... Yet in this
point of view, there is, in my opinion, a very important sanitary context to be
added. It must be remembered that privation of food is very reluctantly borne,
and that as a rule great poorness of diet will only come when other privations
have preceded it. Long before insufficiency of diet is a matter of hygienic
concern, long before the physiologist would think of counting the grains of
nitrogen and carbon which intervene between life and starvation, the household
will have been utterly destitute of material comfort; clothing and fuel will
have been even scantier than food – against inclemencies of weather there will
have been no adequate protection – dwelling space will have been stinted to the
degree in which overcrowding produces or increases disease; of household
utensils and furniture there will have been scarcely any ‒ even
cleanliness will have been found costly or difficult, and if there still be
self-respectful endeavours to maintain it, every such endeavour will represent
additional pangs of hunger. The home, too, will be where shelter can be
cheapest bought; in quarters where commonly there is least fruit of sanitary
supervision, least drainage, least scavenging, least suppression of public
nuisances, least or worst water supply, and, if in town, least light and air.
Such are the sanitary dangers to which poverty is almost certainly exposed,
when it is poverty enough to imply scantiness of food. And while the sum of
them is of terrible magnitude against life, the mere scantiness of food is in
itself of very serious moment.... These are painful reflections, especially
when it is remembered that the poverty to which they advert is not the deserved
poverty of idleness. In all cases it is the poverty of working populations.
Indeed, as regards the in-door operatives, the work which obtains the scanty
pittance of food, is for the most part excessively prolonged. Yet evidently it
is only in a qualified sense that the work can be deemed self-supporting....
And on a very large scale the nominal self-support can be only a circuit,
longer or shorter, to pauperism.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn936" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref936"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">51</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The intimate connexion between the pangs of
hunger of the most industrious layers of the working class, and the extravagant
consumption, coarse or refined, of the rich, for which capitalist accumulation
is the basis, reveals itself only when the economic laws are known. It is otherwise
with the “housing of the poor.” Every unprejudiced observer sees that the
greater the centralisation of the means of production, the greater is the
corresponding heaping together of the labourers, within a given space; that
therefore the swifter capitalistic accumulation, the more miserable are the
dwellings of the working-people. “Improvements” of towns, accompanying the
increase of wealth, by the demolition of badly built quarters, the erection of
palaces for banks, warehouses, &amp;c., the widening of streets for business
traffic, for the carriages of luxury, and for the introduction of tramways,
&amp;c., drive away the poor into even worse and more crowded hiding places. On
the other hand, every one knows that the dearness of dwellings is in inverse
ratio to their excellence, and that the mines of misery are exploited by house
speculators with more profit or less cost than ever were the mines of Potosi.
The antagonistic character of capitalist accumulation, and therefore of the
capitalistic relations of property generally,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn937" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref937"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">52</span></a>
is here so evident, that even the official English reports on this subject teem
with heterodox onslaughts on “property and its rights.” With the development of
industry, with the accumulation of capital, with the growth and “improvement”
of towns, the evil makes such progress that the mere fear of contagious
diseases which do not spare even “respectability,” brought into existence from
1847 to 1864 no less than 10 Acts of Parliament on sanitation, and that the
frightened bourgeois in some towns, as Liverpool, Glasgow, &amp;c., took
strenuous measures through their municipalities. Nevertheless Dr. Simon, in his
report of 1865, says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Speaking
generally, it may be said that the evils are uncontrolled in England.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By order of the Privy Council, in 1864, an
inquiry was made into the conditions of the housing of the agricultural
labourers, in 1865 of the poorer classes in the towns. The results of the
admirable work of Dr. Julian Hunter are to be found in the seventh (1865) and
eighth (1866) reports on “Public Health.” To the agricultural labourers, I
shall come later. On the condition of town dwellings, I quote, as preliminary,
a general remark of Dr. Simon.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Although my
official point of view,” he says, “is one exclusively physical, common humanity
requires that the other aspect of this evil should not be ignored .... In its
higher degrees it [<i class="calibre4">i.e</i>., over-crowding] almost necessarily involves such
negation of all delicacy, such unclean confusion of bodies and bodily
functions, such exposure of animal and sexual nakedness, as is rather bestial
than human. To be subject to these influences is a degradation which must
become deeper and deeper for those on whom it continues to work. To children
who are born under its curse, it must often be a very baptism into infamy. And
beyond all measure hopeless is the wish that persons thus circumstanced should
ever in other respects aspire to that atmosphere of civilisation which has its
essence in physical and moral cleanliness.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn938" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref938"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">53</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">London takes the first place in over-crowded
habitations, absolutely unfit for human beings.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“He feels
clear,” says Dr. Hunter, “on two points; first, that there are about 20 large
colonies in London, of about 10,000 persons each, whose miserable condition
exceeds almost anything he has seen elsewhere in England, and is almost
entirely the result of their bad house accommodation; and second, that the
crowded and dilapidated condition of the houses of these colonies is much worse
than was the case 20 years ago.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn939" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref939"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">54</span></a> “It is

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Further, the better-off part of the working
class, together with the small shopkeepers and other elements of the lower
middle class, falls in London more and more under the curse of these vile conditions
of dwelling, in proportion as “improvements,” and with them the demolition of
old streets and houses, advance, as factories and the afflux of human beings

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There is almost no house-property in London that
is not overburdened with a number of middlemen. For the price of land in London
is always very high in comparison with its yearly revenue, and therefore every
buyer speculates on getting rid of it again at a jury price (the expropriation
valuation fixed by jurymen), or on pocketing an extraordinary increase of value
arising from the neighbourhood of some large establishment. As a consequence of
this there is a regular trade in the purchase of “fag-ends of leases.” </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Gentlemen in

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The workhouses are already over-crowded, and the
“improvements” already sanctioned by Parliament are only just begun. If
labourers are driven away by the demolition of their old houses, they do not
leave their old parish, or at most they settle down on its borders, as near as
they can get to it.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“They try, of
course, to remain as near as possible to their workshops. The inhabitants do
not go beyond the same or the next parish, parting their two-room tenements
into single rooms, and crowding even those.... Even at an advanced rent, the
people who are displaced will hardly be able to get an accommodation so good as
the meagre one they have left.... Half the workmen ... of the Strand ... walked

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This same Strand, a main thoroughfare which
gives strangers an imposing idea of the wealth of London, may serve as an
example of the packing together of human beings in that town. In one of its
parishes, the Officer of Health reckoned 581 persons per acre, although half
the width of the Thames was reckoned in. It will be self-understood that every
sanitary measure, which, as has been the case hitherto in London, hunts the
labourers from one quarter, by demolishing uninhabitable houses, serves only to
crowd them together yet more closely in another.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Either,”
says Dr. Hunter, “the whole proceeding will of necessity stop as an absurdity,
or the public compassion (!) be effectually aroused to the obligation which may
now be without exaggeration called national, of supplying cover to those who by

they can by periodical payments reward those who will provide it for them.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn945" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref945"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">60</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

land, of houses, the businessman, when expropriated by “improvements” such as
railroads, the building of new streets, &amp;c., not only receives full
indemnity. He must, according to law, human and divine, be comforted for his
enforced “abstinence” over and above this by a thumping profit. The labourer,
with his wife and child and chattels, is thrown out into the street, and – if
he crowds in too large numbers towards quarters of the town where the vestries
insist on decency, he is prosecuted in the name of sanitation! </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The result
of this change is not only that the class of town people is enormously
increased, but the old close-packed little towns are now centres, built round

are abandoned by them for the pleasanter outskirts. The successors of these
rich are occupying the larger houses at the rate of a family to each room [...

unwholesome yards or courts, and for space, light, air, and cleanliness, are
models of insufficiency and insalubrity, and a disgrace to any civilised
community; in them men, women, and children lie at night huddled together: and
as regards the men, the night-shift succeed the day-shift, and the day-shift
the night-shift in unbroken series for some time together, the beds having

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As a result of the ebbing and flowing of capital
and labour, the state of the dwellings of an industrial town may today be
bearable, tomorrow hideous. Or the aedileship of the town may have pulled
itself together for the removal of the most shocking abuses. Tomorrow, like a
swarm of locusts, come crowding in masses of ragged Irishmen or decayed English
agricultural labourers. They are stowed away in cellars and lofts, or the
hitherto respectable labourer’s dwelling is transformed into a lodging house
whose <i class="calibre4">personnel</i> changes as quickly as the billets in the 30 years’ war.
Example: Bradford (Yorkshire). There the municipal philistine was just busied
with urban improvements. Besides, there were still in Bradford, in 1861, 1,751
uninhabited houses. But now comes that revival of trade which the mildly
liberal Mr. Forster, the negro’s friend, recently crowed over with so much
grace. With the revival of trade came of course an overflow from the waves of
the ever fluctuating “reserve army” or “relative surplus population.” The
frightful cellar habitations and rooms registered in the list,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn949" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref949"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">64</span></a> which Dr. Hunter obtained from the agent
of an Insurance Company, were for the most part inhabited by well-paid
labourers. They declared that they would willingly pay for better dwellings if
they were to be had. Meanwhile, they become degraded, they fall ill, one and
all, whilst the mildly liberal Forster, M. P., sheds tears over the blessings
of Free Trade, and the profits of the eminent men of Bradford who deal in
worsted. In the Report of September, 1865, Dr. Bell, one of the poor law
doctors of Bradford, ascribes the frightful mortality of fever-patients in his
district to the nature of their dwellings.</span></p>

include any roll of dirty old rags, or an armful of shavings ‒ have an
average of 3.3 persons to each, many have 5 and 6 persons to each, and some
people, I am told, are absolutely without beds; they sleep in their ordinary
clothes, on the bare boards – young men and women, married and unmarried, all
together. I need scarcely add that many of these dwellings are dark, damp,
dirty, stinking holes, utterly unfit for human habitations; they are the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We turn now to a class of people whose origin is
agricultural, but whose occupation is in great part industrial. They are the
light infantry of capital, thrown by it, according to its needs, now to this
point, now to that. When they are not on the march, they “camp.” Nomad labour
is used for various operations of building and draining, brick-making,
lime-burning, railway-making, &amp;c. A flying column of pestilence, it carries
into the places in whose neighbourhood it pitches its camp, small-pox, typhus,
cholera, scarlet fever, &amp;c.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn952" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref952"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">67</span></a> In
undertakings that involve much capital outlay, such as railways, &amp;c., the
contractor himself generally provides his army with wooden huts and the like,
thus improvising villages without any sanitary provisions, outside the control
of the local boards, very profitable to the contractor, who exploits the
labourers in two-fold fashion – as soldiers of industry and as tenants.
According as the wooden hut contains 1, 2, or 3 holes, its inhabitant, navvy,
or whatever he may be, has to pay 1, 3, or 4 shillings weekly.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn953" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref953"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">68</span></a><sup class="calibre15"> </sup>One example will suffice. In
September, 1864, Dr. Simon reports that the Chairman of the Nuisances Removal
Committee of the parish of Sevenoaks sent the following denunciation to Sir
George Grey, Home Secretary: – </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Small-pox
cases were rarely heard of in this parish until about twelve months ago.
Shortly before that time, the works for a railway from Lewisham to Tunbridge
were commenced here, and, in addition to the principal works being in the immediate
neighbourhood of this town, here was also established the depôt for the whole
of the works, so that a large number of persons was of necessity employed here.
As cottage accommodation could not be obtained for them all, huts were built in
several places along the line of the works by the contractor, Mr. Jay, for
their especial occupation. These huts possessed no ventilation nor drainage,
and, besides, were necessarily over-crowded, because each occupant had to
accommodate lodgers, whatever the number in his own family might be, although
there were only two rooms to each tenement. The consequences were, according to
the medical report we received, that in the night-time these poor people were
compelled to endure all the horror of suffocation to avoid the pestiferous
smells arising from the filthy, stagnant water, and the privies close under
their windows. Complaints were at length made to the Nuisances Removal
Committee by a medical gentleman who had occasion to visit these huts, and he
spoke of their condition as dwellings in the most severe terms, and he
expressed his fears that some very serious consequences might ensue, unless
some sanitary measures were adopted. About a year ago, Mr. Jay promised to
appropriate a hut, to which persons in his employ, who were suffering from
contagious diseases, might at once be removed. He repeated that promise on the
23rd July last, but although since the date of the last Promise there have been
several cases of small-pox in his huts, and two deaths from the same disease,
yet he has taken no steps whatever to carry out his promise. On the 9th
September instant, Mr. Kelson, surgeon, reported to me further cases of
small-pox in the same huts, and he described their condition as most
disgraceful. I should add, for your <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="69a"></a>(the Home Secretary’s)
information that an isolated house, called the Pest-house, which is set apart
for parishioners who might be suffering from infectious diseases, has been
continually occupied by such patients for many months past, and is also now
occupied; that in one family five children died from small-pox and fever; that
from the 1st April to the 1st September this year, a period of five months,
there have been no fewer than ten deaths from small-pox in the parish, four of
them being in the huts already referred to; that it is impossible to ascertain
the exact number of persons who have suffered from that disease although they
are known to be many, from the fact of the families keeping it as private as
possible.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn954" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref954"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">69</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The labourers in coal and other mines belong to
the best paid categories of the British proletariat. The price at which they
buy their wages was shown on an earlier page.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn955" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref955"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">70</span></a>
Here I merely cast a hurried glance over the conditions of their dwellings. As
a rule, the exploiter of a mine, whether its owner or his tenant, builds a
number of cottages for his hands. They receive cottages and coal for firing
“for nothing” – <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>., these form part of their wages, paid in kind.
Those who are not lodged in this way receive in compensation £4 per annum. The
mining districts attract with rapidity a large population, made up of the
miners themselves, and the artisans, shopkeepers, &amp;c., that group
themselves around them. The ground-rents are high, as they are generally where
population is dense. The master tries, therefore, to run up, within the
smallest space possible at the mouth of the pit, just so many cottages as are
necessary to pack together his hands and their families. If new mines are
opened in the neighbourhood, or old ones are again set working, the pressure
increases. In the construction of the cottages, only one point of view is of
moment, the “abstinence” of the capitalist from all expenditure that is not
absolutely unavoidable.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The lodging
which is obtained by the pitman and other labourers connected with the
collieries of Northumberland and Durham,” says Dr. Julian Hunter, “is perhaps,
on the whole, the worst and the dearest of which any large specimens can be
found in England, the similar parishes of Monmouthshire excepted.... The
extreme badness is in the high number of men found in one room, in the
smallness of the ground-plot on which a great number of houses are thrust, the
want of water, the absence of privies, and the frequent placing of one house on
the top of another, or distribution into flats, ... the lessee acts as if the
whole colony were encamped, not resident.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn956" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref956"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">71</span></a>
<a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="72a"></a></span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“In pursuance
of my instructions,” says Dr. Stevens, “I visited most of the large colliery
villages in the Durham Union.... With very few exceptions, the general
statement that no means are taken to secure the health of the inhabitants would
be true of all of them.... All colliers are bound ['bound,’ an expression
which, like bondage, dates from the age of serfdom] to the colliery lessee or
owner for twelve months.... If the colliers express discontent, or in any way
annoy the ‘viewer,’ a mark of memorandum is made against their names, and, at
the annual ‘binding,’ such men are turned off... It appears to me that no part
of the ‘truck system’ could be worse than what obtains in these
densely-populated districts. The collier is bound to take as part of his hiring
a house surrounded with pestiferous influences; he cannot help himself, and it
appears doubtful whether anyone else can help him except his proprietor (he is,
to all intents and purposes, a serf), and his proprietor first consults his
balance-sheet, and the result is tolerably certain. The collier is also often
supplied with water by the proprietor, which, whether it be good or bad, he has
to pay for, or rather he suffers a deduction for from his wages.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn957" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref957"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">72</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In conflict with “public opinion,” or even with
the Officers of Health, capital makes no difficulty about “justifying” the
conditions partly dangerous, partly degrading, to which it confines the working
and domestic life of the labourer, on the ground that they are necessary for
profit. It is the same thing when capital “abstains” from protective measures
against dangerous machinery in the factory, from appliances for ventilation and
for safety in mines, &amp;c. It is the same here with the housing of the
miners. Dr. Simon, medical officer of the Privy Council, in his official Report
says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“In apology
for the wretched household accommodation ... it is alleged that miners are
commonly worked on lease; that the duration of the lessee’s interest (which in
collieries is commonly for 21 years), is not so long that he should deem it
worth his while to create good accommodation for his labourers, and for the
tradespeople and others whom the work attracts; that even if he were disposed
to act liberally in the matter, this disposition would commonly be defeated by
his landlord’s tendency to fix on him, as ground-rent, an exorbitant additional
charge for the privilege of having on the surface of the ground the decent and
comfortable village which the labourers of the subterranean property ought to
inhabit, and that prohibitory price (if not actual prohibition) equally
excludes others who might desire to build. It would be foreign to the purpose
of this report to enter upon any discussion of the merits of the above apology.
Nor here is it even needful to consider where it would be that, if decent
accommodation were provided, the cost ... would eventually fall – whether on
landlord, or lessee, or labourer, or public. But in presence of such shameful
facts as are vouched for in the annexed reports [those of Dr. Hunter, Dr.
Stevens, &amp;c.] a remedy may well be claimed.... Claims of landlordship are
being so used as to do great public wrong. The landlord in his capacity of
mine-owner invites an industrial colony to labour on his estate, and then in
his capacity of surface-owner makes it impossible that the labourers whom he
collects, should find proper lodging where they must live. The lessee [the
capitalist exploiter] meanwhile has no pecuniary motive for resisting that
division of the bargain; well knowing that if its latter conditions be
exorbitant, the consequences fall, not on him, that his labourers on whom they
fall have not education enough to know the value of their sanitary rights, that
neither obscenest lodging nor foulest drinking water will be appreciable
inducements towards a ‘strike.’”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn958" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref958"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">73</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

working class</span></h4>

<p class="calibre64"><span lang="EN-GB">Before I
turn to the regular agricultural labourers, I may be allowed to show, by one
example, how industrial revulsions affect even the best-paid, the aristocracy,
of the working class. It will be remembered that the year 1857 brought one of
the great crises with which the industrial cycle periodically ends. The next
termination of the cycle was due in 1866. Already discounted in the regular
factory districts by the cotton famine, which threw much capital from its
wonted sphere into the great centres of the money-market, the crisis assumed,
at this time, an especially financial character. Its outbreak in 1866 was
signalised by the failure of a gigantic London Bank, immediately followed by
the collapse of countless swindling companies. One of the great London branches
of industry involved in the catastrophe was iron shipbuilding. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="74a"></a>The
magnates of this trade had not only over-produced beyond all measure during the
overtrading time, but they had, besides, engaged in enormous contracts on the
speculation that credit would be forthcoming to an equivalent extent. Now, a
terrible reaction set in, that even at this hour (the end of March, 1867)
continues in this and other London industries.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn959" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref959"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">74</span></a>
To show the condition of the labourers, I quote the following from the
circumstantial report of a correspondent of the <i class="calibre4">Morning Star,</i> who, at
the end of 1866, and beginning of 1867, visited the chief centres of distress:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“In the East
End districts of Poplar, Millwall, Greenwich, Deptford, Limehouse and Canning
Town, at least 15,000 workmen and their families were in a state of utter
destitution, and 3,000 skilled mechanics were breaking stones in the workhouse
yard (after distress of over half a year’s duration).... I had great difficulty
in reaching the workhouse door, for a hungry crowd besieged it.... They were
waiting for their tickets, but the time had not yet arrived for the
distribution. The yard was a great square place with an open shed running all
round it, and several large heaps of snow covered the paving-stones in the
middle. In the middle, also, were little wicker-fenced spaces, like sheep pens,
where in finer weather the men worked; but on the day of my visit the pens were
so snowed up that nobody could sit in them. Men were busy, however, in the open
shed breaking paving-stones into macadam. Each man had a big paving-stone for a
seat, and he chipped away at the rime-covered granite with a big hammer until
he had broken up, and think! five bushels of it, and then he had done his day’s
work, and got his day’s pay – threepence and an allowance of food. In another
part of the yard was a rickety little wooden house, and when we opened the door
of it, we found it filled with men who were huddled together shoulder to
shoulder for the warmth of one another’s bodies and breath. They were picking
oakum and disputing the while as to which could work the longest on a given
quantity of food – for endurance was the point of honour. Seven thousand ... in
this one workhouse ... were recipients of relief ... many hundreds of them ...
it appeared, were, six or eight months ago, earning the highest wages paid to
artisans.... Their number would be more than doubled by the count of those who,
having exhausted all their savings, still refuse to apply to the parish,
because they have a little left to pawn. Leaving the workhouse, I took a walk
through the streets, mostly of little one-storey houses, that abound in the
neighbourhood of Poplar. My guide was a member of the Committee of the
Unemployed.... My first call was on an ironworker who had been seven and twenty
weeks out of employment. I found the man with his family sitting in a little
back room. The room was not bare of furniture, and there was a fire in it. This
was necessary to keep the naked feet of the young children from getting frost
bitten, for it was a bitterly cold day. On a tray in front of the fire lay a
quantity of oakum, which the wife and children were picking in return for their
allowance from the parish. The man worked in the stone yard of the workhouse
for a certain ration of food, and threepence per day. He had now come home to
dinner quite hungry, as he told us with a melancholy smile, and his dinner
consisted of a couple of slices of bread and dripping, and a cup of milkless
tea.... The next door at which we knocked was opened by a middle-aged woman,
who, without saying a word, led us into a little back parlour, in which sat all
her family, silent and fixedly staring at a rapidly dying fire. Such
desolation, such hopelessness was about these people and their little room, as
I should not care to witness again. ‘Nothing have they done, sir,’ said the
woman, pointing to her boys, ‘for six and twenty weeks; and all our money gone
– all the twenty pounds that me and father saved when times were better,
thinking it would yield a little to keep us when we got past work. Look at it,’
she said, almost fiercely, bringing out a bank-book with all its well kept
entries of money paid in, and money taken out, so that we could see how the
little fortune had begun with the first five shilling deposit, and had grown by
little and little to be twenty pounds, and how it had melted down again till
the sum in hand got from pounds to shillings, and the last entry made the book
as worthless as a blank sheet. This family received relief from the workhouse,
and it furnished them with just one scanty meal per day.... Our next visit was to
an iron labourer’s wife, whose husband had worked in the yards. We found her
ill from want of food, lying on a mattress in her clothes, and just covered
with a strip of carpet, for all the bedding had been pawned. Two wretched
children were tending her, themselves looking as much in need of nursing as
their mother. Nineteen weeks of enforced idleness had brought them to this
pass, and while the mother told the history of that bitter past, she moaned as
if all her faith in a future that should atone for it were dead.... On getting
outside a young fellow came running after us, and asked us to step inside his
house and see if anything could be done for him. A young wife, two pretty
children, a cluster of pawn-tickets, and a bare room were all he had to show.” </span></p>

There are 40,000 of them.... In our presence, in one quarter of this wonderful
metropolis, are packed – next door to the most enormous accumulation of wealth
the world ever saw – cheek by jowl with this are 40,000 helpless, starving
people. These thousands are now breaking in upon the other quarters; always
half-starving, they cry their misery in our ears, they cry to Heaven, they tell
us from their miserable dwellings, that it is impossible for them to find work,
and useless for them to beg. The local ratepayers themselves are driven by the
parochial charges to the verge of pauperism.” – (<i class="calibre4">Standard,</i> 5th April,
1867.) </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As it is the fashion amongst English capitalists
to quote Belgium as the Paradise of the labourer because “freedom of labour,”
or what is the same thing, “freedom of capital,” is there limited neither by
the despotism of Trades’ Unions, nor by Factory Acts, a word or two on the
“happiness” of the Belgian labourer. Assuredly no one was more thoroughly
initiated in the mysteries of this happiness than the late M. Ducpétiaux,
inspector-general of Belgian prisons and charitable institutions, and member of
the central commission of Belgian statistics. Let us take his work: “Budgets
économiques des classes ouvrières de la Belgique,” Bruxelles, 1855. Here we
find among other matters, a normal Belgian labourer’s family, whose yearly
income and expenditure he calculates on very exact data, and whose conditions
of nourishment are then compared with those of the soldier, sailor, and
prisoner. The family “consists of father, mother, and four children.” Of these
6 persons “four may be usefully employed the whole year through.” It is assumed
that “there is no sick person nor one incapable of work, among them,” nor are
there “expenses for religious, moral, and intellectual purposes, except a very
small sum for church sittings,” nor “contributions to savings banks or benefit
societies,” nor “expenses due to luxury or the result of improvidence.” The
father and eldest son, however, allow themselves “the use of tobacco,” and on
Sundays “go to the <i class="calibre4">cabaret</i>,” for which a whole 86 centimes a week are
reckoned.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“From a
general compilation of wages allowed to the labourers in different trades, it
follows that the highest average of daily wage is 1 franc 56c., for men, 89
centimes for women, 56 centimes for boys, and 55 centimes for girls. Calculated
at this rate, the resources of the family would amount, at the maximum, to 1,068
francs a-year.... In the family ... taken as typical we have calculated all
possible resources. But in ascribing wages to the mother of the family we <i class="calibre4">raise
the question of the direction of the household. </i>How will its internal
economy be cared for? Who will look after the young children? Who will get
ready the meals, do the washing and mending? This is the dilemma incessantly
presented to the labourers.” </span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“We see that
few labouring families can reach, we will not say the average of the sailor or
soldier, but even that of the prisoner. The general average (of the cost of
each prisoner in the different prisons during the period 1847-1849), has been
63 centimes for all prisons. This figure, compared with that of the daily
maintenance of the labourer, shows a difference of 13 centimes. It must be
remarked further, that if in the prisons it is necessary to set down in the
account the expenses of administration and surveillance, on the other hand, the
prisoners have not to pay for their lodging; that the purchases they make at
the canteens are not included in the expenses of maintenance, and that these
expenses are greatly lowered in consequence of the large number of persons that
make up the establishments, and of contracting for or buying wholesale, the
food and other things that enter into their consumption.... How comes it,
however, that a great number, we might say, a great majority, of labourers,
live in a more economical way? It is ... by adopting expedients, the secret of
which only the labourer knows; by reducing his daily rations; by substituting
rye-bread for wheat; by eating less meat, or even none at all, and the same
with butter and condiments; by contenting themselves with one or two rooms
where the family is crammed together, where boys and girls sleep side by side,
often on the same pallet; by economy of clothing, washing, decency; by giving
up the Sunday diversions; by, in short, resigning themselves to the most
painful privations. Once arrived at this extreme limit, the least rise in the
price of food, stoppage of work, illness, increases the labourer’s distress and
determines his complete ruin; debts accumulate, credit fails, the most
necessary clothes and furniture are pawned, and finally, the family asks to be
enrolled on the list of paupers.” (Ducpétiaux, l. c., pp. 151, 154, 155.)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In fact, in this “Paradise of capitalists” there
follows, on the smallest change in the price of the most essential means of
subsistence, a change in the number of deaths and crimes! (See Manifesto of the
Maatschappij: “De Vlamingen Vooruit!” Brussels, 1860, pp. 15, 16.) In all
Belgium are 930,000 families, of whom, according to the official statistics,
90,000 are wealthy and on the list of voters = 450,000 persons; 390,000
families of the lower middle-class in towns and villages, the greater part of
them constantly sinking into the proletariat, = 1,950,000 persons. Finally,
450,000 working class families = 2,250,000 persons, of whom the model ones
enjoy the happiness depicted by Ducpétiaux. Of the 450,000 working class
families, over 200,000 are on the pauper list. </span></p>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">E. The British Agricultural Proletariat</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Nowhere
does the antagonistic character of capitalistic production and accumulation
assert itself more brutally than in the progress of English agriculture
(including cattle-breeding) and the retrogression of the English agricultural
labourer. Before I turn to his present situation, a rapid retrospect. Modern
agriculture dates in England from the middle of the 18th century, although the
revolution in landed property, from which the changed mode of production starts
as a basis, has a much earlier date. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="76a"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="75a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If we take
the statements of Arthur Young, a careful observer, though a superficial
thinker, as to the agricultural labourer of 1771, the latter plays a very
pitiable part compared with his predecessor of the end of the 14th century,</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“when the
labourer ... could live in plenty, and accumulate wealth,” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn960" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref960"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">75</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">not to
speak of the 15th century, “the golden age of the English labourer in town and
country.” We need not, however, go back so far. In a very instructive work of
the year 1777 we read:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The great
farmer is nearly mounted to a level with him [the gentleman]; while the poor
labourer is depressed almost to the earth. His unfortunate situation will fully
appear, by taking a comparative view of it, only forty years ago, and at
present.... Landlord and tenant ... have both gone hand in hand in keeping the
labourer down.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn961" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref961"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">76</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is then
proved in detail that the real agricultural wages between 1737 and 1777 fell
nearly ¼ or 25 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Modern
policy,” says Dr. Richard Price also, “is, indeed, more favourable to the
higher classes of people; and the consequences may in time prove that the whole
kingdom will consist of only gentry and beggars, or of grandees and slaves.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn962" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref962"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">77</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Nevertheless,
the position of the English agricultural labourer from 1770 to 1780, with
regard to his food and dwelling, as well as to his self-respect, amusements,
&amp;c., is an ideal never attained again since that time. His average wage
expressed in pints of wheat was from 1770 to 1771, 90 pints, in Eden’s time
(1797) only 65, in 1808 but 60.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn963" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref963"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">78</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The state
of the agricultural labourer at the end of the Anti-Jacobin War, during which
landed proprietors, farmers, manufacturers, merchants, bankers, stockbrokers,
army-contractors, &amp;c., enriched themselves so extraordinarily, has been
already indicated above. The nominal wages rose in consequence partly of the
bank-note depreciation, partly of a rise in the price of the primary means of
subsistence independent of this depreciation. But the actual wage-variation can
be evidenced in a very simple way, without entering into details that are here
unnecessary. The Poor Law and its administration were in 1795 and 1814 the
same. It will be remembered how this law was carried out in the country
districts: in the form of alms the parish made up the nominal wage to the
nominal sum required for the simple vegetation of the labourer. The ratio
between the wages paid by the farmer, and the wage-deficit made good by the
parish, shows us two things. First, the falling of wages below their minimum;
second, the degree in which the agricultural labourer was a compound of wage
labourer and pauper, or the degree in which he had been turned into a serf of
his parish. Let us take one county that represents the average condition of
things in all counties. In Northamptonshire, in 1795, the average weekly wage
was 7s. 6d.; <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="80a"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="79a"></a>the total yearly expenditure of a
family of 6 persons, £36 12s. 5d.; their total income, £29 18s.; deficit made
good by the parish, £6 14s. 5d. In 1814, in the same county, the weekly wage
was 12s. 2d.; the total yearly expenditure of a family of 5 persons, £54 18s.
4d.; their total income, £36, 2s.; deficit made good by the parish, £18 6s. 4d.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn964" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref964"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">79</span></a> In 1795 the deficit was less than 1/4 the
wage, in 1814, more than half. It is self-evident that, under these
circumstances, the meagre comforts that Eden still found in the cottage of the
agricultural labourer, had vanished by 1814.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn965" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref965"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">80</span></a>
Of all the animals kept by the farmer, the labourer, the <em class="calibre4">instrumentum vocale</em>,
was, thenceforth, the most oppressed, the worst nourished, the most brutally
treated. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The same
state of things went on quietly until</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“the Swing
riots, in 1830, revealed to us (<em class="calibre4">i.e</em>., the ruling classes) by the light
of blazing corn-stacks, that misery and black mutinous discontent smouldered
quite as fiercely under the surface of agricultural as of manufacturing
England.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn966" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref966"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">81</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At this
time, Sadler, in the House of Commons, christened the agricultural labourers
“white slaves,” and a Bishop echoed the epithet in the Upper House. The most
notable political economist of that period – E. G. Wakefield – says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The peasant
of the South of England ... is not a freeman, nor is he a slave; he is a
pauper.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn967" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref967"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">82</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The time
just before the repeal of the Corn Laws threw new light on the condition of the
agricultural labourers. On the one hand, it was to the interest of the
middle-class agitators to prove how little the Corn Laws protected the actual
producers of the corn. On the other hand, the industrial bourgeoisie foamed
with sullen rage at the denunciations of the factory system by the landed
aristocracy, at the pretended sympathy with the woes of the factory operatives,
of those utterly corrupt, heartless, and genteel loafers, and at their
“diplomatic zeal” for factory legislation. It is an old English proverb that
“when thieves fall out, honest men come by their own,” and, in fact, the noisy,
passionate quarrel between the two fractions of the ruling class about the
question, which of the two exploited the labourers the more shamefully, was on
each hand the midwife of the truth. Earl Shaftesbury, then Lord Ashley, was
commander-in-chief in the aristocratic, philanthropic, anti-factory campaign.
He was, therefore, in 1845, a favourite subject in the revelations of the <em class="calibre4">Morning
Chronicle</em> on the condition of the agricultural labourers. This journal,
then the most important Liberal organ, sent special commissioners into the
agricultural districts, who did not content themselves with mere general
descriptions and statistics, but published the names both of the labouring
families examined and of their landlords. The following list gives the wages
paid in three villages in the neighbourhood of Blanford, Wimbourne, and Poole.
The villages are the property of Mr. G. Bankes and of the Earl of Shaftesbury.
It will be noted that, just like Bankes, this “low church pope,” this head of
English pietists, pockets a great part of the miserable wages of the labourers
under the pretext of house-rent: –</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The repeal
of the Corn Laws gave a marvellous impulse to English agriculture. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn969" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref969"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">84</span></a>Drainage on the most extensive scale, new
methods of stall-feeding, and of the artificial cultivation of green crops,
introduction of mechanical manuring apparatus, new treatment of clay soils,
increased use of mineral manures, employment of the steam-engine, and of all
kinds of new machinery, more intensive cultivation generally, characterised
this epoch. Mr. Pusey, Chairman of the Royal Agricultural Society, declares
that the (relative) expenses of farming have been reduced nearly one half by
the introduction of new machinery. On the other hand, the actual return of the
soil rose rapidly. Greater outlay of capital per acre, and, as a consequence,
more rapid concentration of farms, were essential conditions of the new method.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn970" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref970"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">85</span></a> At the same time, the area under
cultivation increased, from 1846 to 1856, by 464,119 acres, without reckoning
the great area in the Eastern Counties which was transformed from rabbit
warrens and poor pastures into magnificent corn-fields. It has already been
seen that, at the same time, the total number of persons employed in
agriculture fell. As far as the actual agricultural labourers of both sexes and
of all ages are concerned, their number fell from 1,241,396, in 1851, to 1,163,
217 in 1861. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn971" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref971"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">86</span></a> If the English
Registrar-General, therefore, rightly remarks:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The increase
of farmers and farm-labourers, since 1801, bears no kind of proportion ... to
the increase of agricultural produce,”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn972" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref972"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">87</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">this
disproportion obtains much more for the last period, when a positive decrease
of the agricultural population went hand in hand with increase of the area
under cultivation, with more intensive cultivation, unheard-of accumulation of
the capital incorporated with the soil, and devoted to its working, an
augmentation in the products of the soil without parallel in the history of
English agriculture, plethoric rent-rolls of landlords, and growing wealth of
the capitalist farmers. If we take this, together with the swift, unbroken
extension of the markets, <em class="calibre4">viz</em>., the towns, and the reign of Free Trade,
then the agricultural labourer was at last, <em class="calibre4">post tot discrimina rerum,</em>
placed in circumstances that ought, <em class="calibre4">secundum artem,</em> to have made him
drunk with happiness. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But
Professor Rogers comes to the conclusion that the lot of the English
agricultural labourer of today, not to speak of his predecessor in the last
half of the 14th and in the 15th century, but only compared with his
predecessor from 1770 to 1780, has changed for the worse to an extraordinary
extent, that “the peasant has again become a serf,” and a serf worse fed and
worse clothed.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn973" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref973"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">88</span></a> Dr. Julian Hunter, in his
epoch making report on the dwellings of the agricultural labourers, says:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The cost of
the hind” (a name for the agricultural labourer, inherited from the time of
serfdom) “is fixed at the lowest possible amount on which he can live ... the
supplies of wages and shelter are not calculated on the profit to be derived
from him. He is a zero in farming calculations ... <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn974" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref974"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">89</span></a> The means [of subsistence] being always
supposed to be a fixed quantity. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn975" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref975"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">90</span></a>As
to any further reduction of his income, he may say, <em class="calibre4">nihil habeo nihil curo.
</em>He has no fears for the future, because he has now only the spare supply
necessary to keep him. He has reached the zero from which are dated the

1863, an official inquiry took place into the conditions of nourishment and
labour of the criminals condemned to transportation and penal servitude. The
results are recorded in two voluminous Blue books. Among other things it is

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The general
result of the inquiry by the medical commission of 1863 on the food of the
lowest fed classes, is already known to the reader. He will remember that the
diet of a great part of the agricultural labourers’ families is below the
minimum necessary “to arrest starvation diseases.” This is especially the case
in all the purely rural districts of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Wilts,
Stafford, Oxford, Berks, and Herts.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The
nourishment obtained by the labourer himself,” says Dr. E. Smith, “is larger
than the average quantity indicates, since he eats a larger share ... necessary
to enable him to perform his labour ... of food than the other members of the
family, including in the poorer districts nearly all the meat and bacon.... The
quantity of food obtained by the wife and also by the children at the period of
rapid growth, is in many cases, in almost every county, deficient, and
particularly in nitrogen.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn982" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref982"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">97</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The male<a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="98a"></a> and female servants living with the farmers themselves are
sufficiently nourished. Their number fell from 288,277 in 1851, to 204,962 in
1861.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“The labour
of women in the fields,” says Dr. Smith, “whatever may be its disadvantages,
... is under present circumstances of great advantage to the family, since it
adds that amount of income which ... provides shoes and clothing and pays the
rent, and thus enables the family to be better fed.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn983" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref983"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">98</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“To the
insufficient quantity and miserable quality of the house accommodation
generally had,” says Dr. Simon, in his official Health Report, “by our
agricultural labourers, almost every page of Dr. Hunter’s report bears
testimony. And gradually, for many years past, the state of the labourer in
these respects has been deteriorating, house-room being now greatly more
difficult for him to find, and, when found, greatly less suitable to his needs
than, perhaps, for centuries had been the case. Especially within the last
twenty or thirty years, the evil has been in very rapid increase, and the
household circumstances of the labourer are now in the highest degree
deplorable. Except in so far as they whom his labour enriches, see fit to treat
him with a kind of pitiful indulgence, he is quite peculiarly helpless in the
matter. Whether he shall find house-room on the land which he contributes to
till, whether the house-room which he gets shall be human or swinish, whether
he shall have the little space of garden that so vastly lessens the pressure of
his poverty – all this does not depend on his willingness and ability to pay
reasonable rent for the decent accommodation he requires, but depends on the
use which others may see fit to make of their ‘right to do as they will with
their own.’ However large may be a farm, there is no law that a certain
proportion of labourers’ dwellings (much less of decent dwellings) shall be
upon it; nor does any law reserve for the labourer ever so little right in that
soil to which his industry is as needful as sun and rain.... An extraneous
element weighs the balance heavily against him ... the influence of the Poor
Law in its provisions concerning settlement and chargeability.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn985" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref985"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">100</span></a> Under this influence, each parish has a
pecuniary interest in reducing to a minimum the number of its resident
labourers: – for, unhappily, agricultural labour instead of implying a safe and
permanent independence for the hardworking labourer and his family, implies for
the most part only a longer or shorter circuit to eventual pauperism – a
pauperism which, during the whole circuit, is so near, that any illness or
temporary failure of occupation necessitates immediate recourse to parochial
relief – and thus all residence of agricultural population in a parish is
glaringly an addition to its poor-rates .... Large proprietors <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn986" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref986"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span> ...
have but to resolve that there shall be no labourers’ dwellings on their
estates, and their estates will thenceforth be virtually free from half their
responsibility for the poor. How far it has been intended, in the English
constitution and law, that this kind of unconditional property in land should
be acquirable, and that a landlord ‘doing as he wills with his own,’ should be
able to treat the cultivators of the soil as aliens, whom he may expel from his
territory, is a question which I do not pretend to discuss.... For that (power)
of eviction ... does not exist only in theory. On a very large scale it
prevails in practice – prevails ... as a main governing condition in the
household circumstances of agricultural labour.... As regards the extent of the
evil, it may suffice to refer to the evidence which Dr. Hunter has compiled
from the last census, that destruction of houses, notwithstanding increased
local demands for them, had, during the last ten years, been in progress in 821
separate parishes or townships of England, so that irrespectively of persons
who had been forced to become non-resident (that is in the parishes in which
they work), these parishes and townships were receiving in 1861, as compared
with 1851, a population 5 1/3 per cent. greater, into houseroom 4½ per cent.
less... When the process of depopulation has completed itself, the result, says
Dr. Hunter, is a show-village where the cottages have been reduced to a few,
and where none but persons who are needed as shepherds, gardeners, or
game-keepers, are allowed to live; regular servants who receive the good
treatment usual to their class.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn987" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref987"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">102</span></a> But the
land requires cultivation, and it will be found that the labourers employed
upon it are not the tenants of the owner, but that they come from a
neighbouring open village, perhaps three miles off, where a numerous small
proprietary had received them when their cottages were destroyed in the close
villages around. Where things are tending to the above result, often the
cottages which stand, testify, in their unrepaired and wretched condition, to
the extinction to which they are doomed. They are seen standing in the various
stages of natural decay. While the shelter holds together, the labourer is
permitted to rent it, and glad enough he will often be to do so, even at the
price of decent lodging. But no repair, no improvement shall it receive, except
such as its penniless occupants can supply. And when at last it becomes quite
uninhabitable – uninhabitable even to the humblest standard of serfdom – it
will be but one more destroyed cottage, and future poor-rates will be somewhat
lightened. While great owners are thus escaping from poor-rates through the
depopulation of lands over which they have control, the nearest town or open
village receive the evicted labourers: the nearest, I say, but this “nearest”
may mean three or four miles distant from the farm where the labourer has his
daily toil. To that daily toil there will then have to be added, as though it
were nothing, the daily need of walking six or eight miles for power of earning
his bread. And whatever farm work is done by his wife and children, is done at
the same disadvantage. Nor is this nearly all the toil which the distance
occasions him. In the open village, cottage-speculators buy scraps of land,
which they throng as densely as they can with the cheapest of all possible
hovels. And into those wretched habitations (which, even if they adjoin the
open country, have some of the worst features of the worst town residences)
crowd the agricultural labourers of England. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn988" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref988"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">103</span></a>....
Nor on the other hand must it be supposed that even when the labourer is housed
upon the lands which he cultivates, his household circumstances are generally
such as his life of productive industry would seem to deserve. Even on princely
estates ... his cottage ... may be of the meanest description. There are
landlords who deem any stye good enough for their labourer and his family, and
who yet do not disdain to drive with him the hardest possible bargain for rent.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn989" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref989"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">104</span></a> It may be but a ruinous one-bedroomed
hut, having no fire-grate, no privy, no opening window, no water supply but the
ditch, no garden – but the labourer is helpless against the wrong.... And the
Nuisances Removal Acts ... are ... a mere dead letter ... in great part
dependent for their working on such cottage-owners as the one from whom his
(the labourer’s) hovel is rented.... From brighter, but exceptional scenes, it
is requisite in the interests of justice, that attention should again be drawn
to the overwhelming preponderance of facts which are a reproach to the
civilisation of England. Lamentable indeed, must be the case, when,
notwithstanding all that is evident with regard to the quality of the present
accommodation, it is the common conclusion of competent observers that even the
general badness of dwellings is an evil infinitely less urgent than their mere
numerical insufficiency. For years the over-crowding of rural labourers’
dwellings has been a matter of deep concern, not only to persons who care for
sanitary good, but to persons who care for decent and moral life. For, again
and again in phrases so uniform that they seem stereotyped, reporters on the
spread of epidemic disease in rural districts, have insisted on the extreme
importance of that over-crowding, as an influence which renders it a quite
hopeless task, to attempt the limiting of any infection which is introduced.
And again and again it has been pointed out that, notwithstanding the many
salubrious influences which there are in country life, the crowding which so
favours the extension of contagious disease, also favours the origination of
disease which is not contagious. And those who have denounced the over-crowded
state of our rural population have not been silent as to a further mischief.
Even where their primary concern has been only with the injury to health, often
almost perforce they have referred to other relations on the subject. In
showing how frequently it happens that adult persons of both sexes, married and
unmarried, are huddled together in single small sleeping rooms, their reports
have carried the conviction that, under the circumstances they describe,
decency must always be outraged, and morality almost of necessity must suffer.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn990" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref990"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">105</span></a> Thus, for instance, in the appendix of
my last annual report, Dr. Ord, reporting on an outbreak of fever at Wing, in
Buckinghamshire, mentions how a young man who had come thither from Wingrave
with fever, “in the first days of his illness slept in a room with nine other
persons. Within a fortnight several of these persons were attacked, and in the
course of a few weeks five out of the nine had fever, and one died...” From Dr.
Harvey, of St. George’s Hospital, who, on private professional business,
visited Wing during the time of the epidemic, I received information exactly in
the sense of the above report.... “A young woman having fever, lay at night in
a room occupied by her father and mother, her bastard child, two young men (her
brothers), and her two sisters, each with a bastard child – 10 persons in all.
A few weeks ago 13 persons slept in it.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn991" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref991"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">106</span></a>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dr. Hunter
investigated 5,375 cottages of agricultural labourers, not only in the purely
agricultural districts, but in all counties of England. Of these, 2,195 had
only one bedroom (often at the same time used as living-room), 2,930 only two,

walls bulged very like a lady’s dress in a curtsey. One gable end was convex,
the other concave, and on this last, unfortunately, stood the chimney, a curved
tube of clay and wood like an elephant’s trunk. A long stick served as prop to
prevent the chimney from falling. The doorway and window were rhomboidal.” Of
17 houses visited, only 4 had more than one bedroom, and those four
overcrowded. The cots with one bedroom sheltered 3 adults and 3 children, a
married couple with 6 children, &amp;c. </span></p>

£4 to £5; weekly wages of the man, 10s. They hope to pay the rent by the
straw-plaiting of the family. The higher the rent, the greater the number that
must work together to pay it. Six adults, living with 4 children in one
sleeping apartment, pay £3 10s. for it. The cheapest house in Dunton, 15 feet
long externally, 10 broad, let for £3. Only one of the houses investigated had
2 bedrooms. A little outside the village, a house whose “tenants dunged against
the house-side,” the lower 9 inches of the door eaten away through sheer
rottenness; the doorway, a single opening closed at night by a few bricks, ingeniously
pushed up after shutting and covered with some matting. Half a window, with
glass and frame, had gone the way of all flesh. Here, without furniture,
huddled together were 3 adults and 5 children. Dunton is not worse than the
rest of Biggleswade Union. </span></p>

</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">In June, 1864, a
man, his wife and 4 children lived in a cot (one-storied cottage). A daughter
came home from service with scarlet fever. She died. One child sickened and
died. The mother and one child were down with typhus when Dr. Hunter was called
in. The father and one child slept outside, but the difficulty of securing
isolation was seen here, for in the crowded market of the miserable village lay
the linen of the fever-stricken household, waiting for the wash. The rent of H.’s
house, 1s. a-week; one bedroom for man, wife, and 6 children. One house let for
8d. a-week, 14 feet 6 inches long, 7 feet broad, kitchen, 6 feet high; the
bedroom without window, fire-place, door, or opening, except into the lobby; no
garden. A man lived here for a little while, with two grown-up daughters and
one grown-up son; father and son slept on the bed, the girls in the passage.
Each of the latter had a child while the family was living here, but one went
to the workhouse for her confinement and then came home. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">30 cottages

males and 54 females. This inequality of the sexes was partly remedied in 1861,
when they numbered 98 males and 87 females; increase in 10 years of 14 men and

landlords, in view of the increasing population, have destroyed about 20 per

his work, answered the question, whether he could not find a cot nearer: “No;
they know better than to take a man in with my large family.” </span></p>

than is considered necessary for a convict. No house had more than one bedroom,
not one of them a back-door; water very scarce; weekly rent from 1s. 4d. to 2s.
In 16 of the houses visited, only 1 man that earned 10s. a-week. The quantity
of air for each person under the circumstances just described corresponds to
that which he would have if he were shut up in a box of 4 feet measuring each

unintentional ventilation. </span></p>

deadly lassitude, a hopeless surrendering up to filth,” reigns in Gamblingay.
The neglect in its centre, becomes mortification at its extremities, north and

this poor rookery too freely. The rents are very high; 8 or 9 persons packed in
one sleeping apartment, in 2 cases 6 adults, each with 1 or 2 children in one

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In this
county, diminutions in the number of persons and of cottages go, in many
parishes, hand in hand. In not less than 22 parishes, however, the destruction
of houses has not prevented increase of population, or has not brought about
that expulsion which, under the name “migration to towns,” generally occurs. In
Fingringhoe, a parish of 3,443 acres, were in 1851, 145 houses; in 1861, only
110. But the people did not wish to go away, and managed even to increase under
these circumstances. In 1851, 252 persons inhabited 61 houses, but in 1861, 262
persons were squeezed into 49 houses. In Basilden, in 1851, 157 persons lived
on 1,827 acres, in 35 houses; at the end of ten years, 180 persons in 27
houses. In the parishes of Fingringhoe, South Fambridge, Widford, Basilden, and
Ramsden Crags, in 1851, 1,392 persons were living on 8,449 acres in 316 houses;
in 1861, on the same area, 1,473 persons in 249 houses. </span></p>

after this, 19 cottages were destroyed in this small parish of 1,720 acres;
population in 1831, 452; in 1852, 382; and in 1861, 341. 14 cottages, each with
1 bedroom, were visited. In one, a married couple, 3 grown-up sons, 1 grown-up
daughter, 4 children – in all 10 in another, 3 adults, 6 children. One of these
rooms, in which 8 people slept, was 12 feet 10 inches long, 12 feet 2 inches
broad, 6 feet 9 inches high: the average, without making any deduction for
projections into the apartment, gave about 130 cubic feet per head. In the 14
sleeping rooms, 34 adults and 33 children. These cottages are seldom provided
with gardens, but many of the inmates are able to farm small allotments at 10s.
or 12s. per rood. These allotments are at a distance from the houses, which are
without privies. The family “must either go to the allotment to deposit their
ordures,” or, as happens in this place, saving your presence, “use a closet
with a trough set like a drawer in a chest of drawers, and drawn out weekly and
conveyed to the allotment to be emptied where its contents were wanted.” In
Japan, the circle of life-conditions moves more decently than this. </span></p>

agricultural population by the destruction of their cottages, go hand in hand.
The more empty the district is of men, the greater is its “relative surplus
population,” the greater is their pressure on the means of employment, the
greater is the absolute excess of the agricultural population over the means
for housing it, the greater, therefore, in the villages is the local surplus
population and the most pestilential packing together of human beings. The
packing together of knots of men in scattered little villages and small country
towns corresponds to the forcible draining of men from the surface of the land.
The continuous superseding of the agricultural labourers, in spite of their
diminishing number and the increasing mass of their products, gives birth to
their pauperism. Their pauperism is ultimately a motive to their eviction and
the chief source of their miserable housing which breaks down their last power
of resistance, and makes them more slaves of the landed proprietors and the
farmers.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn992" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref992"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">107</span></a> Thus the minimum of wages
becomes a law of Nature to them. On the other hand, the land, in spite of its
constant “relative surplus population,” is at the same time underpopulated.
This is seen, not only locally at the points where the efflux of men to towns,
mines, railroad-making, &amp;c., is most marked. It is to be seen everywhere,
in harvest-time as well as in spring and summer, at those frequently recurring
times when English agriculture, so careful and intensive, wants extra hands.
There are always too many agricultural labourers for the ordinary, and always
too few for the exceptional or temporary needs of the cultivation of the soil.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn993" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref993"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">108</span></a> Hence we find in the official documents<a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="109a"></a> contradictory complaints from the same places of deficiency and
excess of labour simultaneously. The temporary or local want of labour brings
about no rise in wages, but a forcing of the women and children into the
fields, and exploitation at an age constantly lowered. As soon as the
exploitation of the women and children takes place on a larger scale, it
becomes in turn a new means of making a surplus population of the male
agricultural labourer and of keeping down his wage. In the east of England
thrives a beautiful fruit of this vicious circle – the so-called gang-system,
to which I must briefly return here. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn994" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref994"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">109</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The gang-system
obtains almost exclusively in the counties of Lincoln, Huntingdon, Cambridge,
Norfolk, Suffolk, and Nottingham, here and there in the neighbouring counties
of Northampton, Bedford, and Rutland. Lincolnshire will serve us as an example.
A large part of this county is new land, marsh formerly, or even, as in others
of the eastern counties just named, won lately from the sea. The steam-engine
has worked wonders in the way of drainage. What were once fens and sandbanks,
bear now a luxuriant sea of corn and the highest of rents. The same thing holds
of the alluvial lands won by human endeavour, as in the island of Axholme and
other parishes on the banks of the Trent. In proportion as the new farms arose,
not only were no new cottages built: old ones were demolished, and the supply
of labour had to come from open villages, miles away, by long roads that wound
along the sides of the hills. There alone had the population formerly found
shelter from the incessant floods of the winter-time. The labourers that dwell
on the farms of 400-1,000 acres <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="110a"></a>(they are called “confined
labourers”) are solely employed on such kinds of agricultural work as is
permanent, difficult, and carried on by aid of horses. For every 100 acres
there is, on an average, scarcely one cottage. A fen farmer, e.g., gave
evidence before the Commission of Inquiry:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“I farm 320
acres, all arable land. I have not one cottage on my farm. I have only one labourer
on my farm now. I have four horsemen lodging about. We get light work done by
gangs.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn995" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref995"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">110</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The soil
requires much light field labour, such as weeding, hoeing, certain processes of
manuring, removing of stones, &amp;c. This is done by the gangs, or organised
bands that dwell in the open villages. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The gang
consists of 10 to 40 or 50 persons, women, young persons of both sexes (13-18
years of age, although the boys are for the most part eliminated at the age of
13), and children of both sexes (6-13 years of age). At the head is the gang
master, always an ordinary agricultural labourer, generally what is called a
bad lot, a scapegrace, unsteady, drunken, but with a dash of enterprise and <em class="calibre4">savoir-faire</em>.
He is the recruiting-sergeant for the gang, which works under him, not under
the farmer. He generally arranges with the latter for piece-work, and his
income, which on the average is not very much above that of an ordinary
agricultural labourer, <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn996" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref996"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">111</span></a>depends
almost entirely upon the dexterity with which he manages to extract within the
shortest time the greatest possible amount of labour from his gang. The farmers
have discovered that women work steadily only under the direction of men, but
that women and children, once set going, impetuously spend their life-force –
as Fourier knew – while the adult male labourer is shrewd enough to economise
his as much as he can. The gang-master goes from one farm to another, and thus
employs his gang from 6 to 8 months in the year. Employment by him is,
therefore, much more lucrative and more certain for the labouring families,
than employment by the individual farmer, who only employs children
occasionally. This circumstance so completely rivets his influence in the open
villages that children are generally only to be hired through his
instrumentality. The lending out of these individually, independently of the
gang, is his second trade. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
“drawbacks” of the system are the overwork of the children and young persons,
the enormous marches that they make daily to and from the farms, 5, 6, and
sometimes 7 miles distant, finally, the demoralisation of the gang. Although
the gang-master, who, in some districts is called “the driver,” is armed with a
long stick, he uses it but seldom, and complaints of brutal treatment are
exceptional. He is a democratic emperor, or a kind of Pied Piper of Hamelin. He
must therefore be popular with his subjects, and he binds them to himself by
the charms of the gipsy life under his direction. Coarse freedom, a noisy
jollity, and obscenest impudence give attractions to the gang. Generally the
gangmaster pays up in a public house; then he returns home at the head of the
procession reeling drunk, propped up right and left by a stalwart virago, while
children and young persons bring up the rear, boisterous, and singing chaffing
and bawdy songs. On the return journey what Fourier calls “phanerogamie,” is
the order of the day. The getting with child of girls of 13 and 14 by their
male companions of the same age, is common. The open villages which supply the contingent
of the gang, become Sodoms and Gomorrahs,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn997" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref997"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">112</span></a>
and have twice as high a rate of illegitimate births as the rest of the
kingdom. The moral character of girls bred in these schools, when married
women, was shown above. Their children, when opium does not give them the
finishing stroke, are born recruits of the gang. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The gang in
its classical form just described, is called the public, common, or tramping
gang. For there are also private gangs. These are made up in the same way as
the common gang, but count fewer members, and work, not under a gang-master,
but under some old farm servant, whom the farmer does not know how to employ in
any better way. The gipsy fun has vanished here, but according to all
witnesses, the payment and treatment of the children is worse. <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="117a"></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The gang-system,
which during the last years has steadily increased,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn998" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref998"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">113</span></a> clearly does not exist for the sake of
the gang-master. It exists for the enrichment of the large farmers, <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn999" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref999"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">114</span></a>and indirectly of the landlords.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1000" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1000"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">115</span></a> For the farmer there is no more
ingenious method of keeping his labourers well below the normal level, and yet
of always having an extra hand ready for extra work, of extracting the greatest
possible amount of labour with the least possible amount of money <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1001" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1001"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">116</span></a> and of making adult male labour
“redundant.” From the exposition already made, it will be understood why, on
the one hand, a greater or less lack of employment for the agricultural
labourer is admitted, while on the other, the gang-system is at the same time
declared “necessary” on account of the want of adult male labour and its
migration to the towns.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1002" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1002"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">117</span></a> The
cleanly weeded land, and the uncleanly human weeds, of Lincolnshire, are pole
and counterpole of capitalistic production.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1003" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1003"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">118</span></a>

<h4 class="calibre24"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre20">F. Ireland</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In concluding this section, we must travel for a
moment to Ireland. First, the main facts of the case. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The population of Ireland had, in 1841, reached
8,222,664; in 1851, it had dwindled to 6,623,985; in 1861, to 5,850,309; in
1866, to 5½ millions, nearly to its level in 1801. The diminution began with
the famine year, 1846, so that Ireland, in less than twenty years, lost more
than 5/16 ths of its people. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1004" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1004"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">119</span></a> Its
total emigration from May, 1851, to July, 1865, numbered 1,591,487: the
emigration during the years 1861-1865 was more than half-a-million. The number
of inhabited houses fell, from 1851-1861, by 52,990. From 1851-1861, the number
of holdings of 15 to 30 acres increased 61,000, that of holdings over 30 acres,
109,000, whilst the total number of all farms fell 120,000, a fall, therefore,
solely due to the suppression of farms under 15 acres – <i class="calibre4">i.e</i>., to their
centralisation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">England, a country with fully developed
capitalist production, and pre-eminently industrial, would have bled to death
with such a drain of population as Ireland has suffered. But Ireland is at
present only an agricultural district of England, marked off by a wide channel
from the country to which it yields corn, wool, cattle, industrial and military
recruits. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The depopulation of Ireland has thrown much of
the land out of cultivation, has greatly diminished the produce of the soil,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1008" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1008"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">123</span></a> and, in spite of the greater area
devoted to cattle breeding, has brought about, in some of its branches, an
absolute diminution, in others, an advance scarcely worthy of mention, and
constantly interrupted by retrogressions. Nevertheless, with the fall in
numbers of the population, rents and farmers’ profits rose, although the latter
not as steadily as the former. The reason of this is easily comprehensible. On
the one hand, with the throwing of small holdings into large ones, and the
change of arable into pasture land, a larger part of the whole produce was
transformed into surplus-produce. The surplus-produce increased, although the
total produce, of which it formed a fraction, decreased. On the other hand, the
money value of this surplus-produce increased yet more rapidly than its mass,
in consequence of the rise in the English market price of meat, wool, &amp;c.,
during the last 20, and especially during the last 10, years. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The scattered means of production that serve the
producers themselves as means of employment and of subsistence, without
expanding their own value by the incorporation of the labour of others, are no
more capital than a product consumed by its own producer is a commodity. If,
with the mass of the population, that of the means of production employed in
agriculture also diminished, the mass of the capital employed in agriculture
increased, because a part of the means of production that were formerly
scattered, was concentrated and turned into capital. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The total capital of Ireland outside
agriculture, employed in industry and trade, accumulated during the last two
decades slowly, and with great and constantly recurring fluctuations; so much
the more rapidly did the concentration of its individual constituents develop.
And, however small its absolute increase, in proportion to the dwindling
population it had increased largely. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Here, then, under our own eyes and on a large
scale, a process is revealed, than which nothing more excellent could be wished
for by orthodox economy for the support of its dogma: that misery springs from
absolute surplus population, and that equilibrium is re-established by
depopulation. This is a far more important experiment than was the plague in
the middle of the 14th century so belauded of Malthusians. Note further: If
only the naïveté of the schoolmaster could apply, to the conditions of
production and population of the nineteenth century, the standard of the 14th,
this naïveté, into the bargain, overlooked the fact that whilst, after the
plague and the decimation that accompanied it, followed on this side of the
Channel, in England, enfranchisement and enrichment of the agricultural
population, on that side, in France, followed greater servitude and more misery.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1009" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1009"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">124</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Irish famine of 1846 killed more than
1,000,000 people, but it killed poor devils only. To the wealth of the country
it did not the slightest damage. The exodus of the next 20 years, an exodus
still constantly increasing, did not, as, <i class="calibre4">e.g.,</i> the Thirty Years’ War,
decimate, along with the human beings, their means of production. Irish genius
discovered an altogether new way of spiriting a poor people thousands of miles
away from the scene of its misery. The exiles transplanted to the United States,
send home sums of money every year as travelling expenses for those left
behind. Every troop that emigrates one year, draws another after it the next.
Thus, instead of costing Ireland anything, emigration forms one of the most
lucrative branches of its export trade. Finally, it is a systematic process,
which does not simply make a passing gap in the population, but sucks out of it
every year more people than are replaced by the births, so that the absolute

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">What were the consequences for the Irish
labourers left behind and freed from the surplus population? That the relative
surplus population is today as great as before 1846; that wages are just as
low, that the oppression of the labourers has increased, that misery is forcing
the country towards a new crisis. The facts are simple. The revolution in
agriculture has kept pace with emigration. The production of relative surplus
population has more than kept pace with the absolute depopulation. A glance at
table C. shows that the change of arable to pasture land must work yet more
acutely in Ireland than in England. In England the cultivation of green crops
increases with the breeding of cattle; in Ireland, it decreases. Whilst a large
number of acres, that were formerly tilled, lie idle or are turned permanently
into grass-land, a great part of the waste land and peat bogs that were unused
formerly, become of service for the extension of cattle-breeding. The smaller
and medium farmers – I reckon among these all who do not cultivate more than
100 acres – still make up about 8/10ths of the whole number.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1011" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1011"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">126</span></a> They are one after the other, and with a
degree of force unknown before, crushed by the competition of an agriculture
managed by capital, and therefore they continually furnish new recruits to the
class of wage labourers. The one great industry of Ireland, linen-manufacture,
requires relatively few adult men and only employs altogether, in spite of its
expansion since the price of cotton rose in 1861-1866, a comparatively
insignificant part of the population. Like all other great modern industries,
it constantly produces, by incessant fluctuations, a relative surplus
population within its own sphere, even with an absolute increase in the mass of
human beings absorbed by it. The misery of the agricultural population forms
the pedestal for gigantic shirt-factories, whose armies of labourers are, for
the most part, scattered over the country. Here, we encounter again the system
described above of domestic industry, which in underpayment and overwork,
possesses its own systematic means for creating supernumerary labourers.
Finally, although the depopulation has not such destructive consequences as
would result in a country with fully developed capitalistic production, it does
not go on without constant reaction upon the home-market. The gap which
emigration causes here, limits not only the local demand for labour, but also
the incomes of small shopkeepers, artisans, tradespeople generally. Hence the
diminution in incomes between £60 and £100 in Table E. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A clear statement of the condition of the
agricultural labourers in Ireland is to be found in the Reports of the Irish
Poor Law Inspectors (1870). <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1012" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1012"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">127</span></a>Officials
of a government which is maintained only by bayonets and by a state of siege,
now open, now disguised, they have to observe all the precautions of language
that their colleagues in England disdain. In spite of this, however, they do
not let their government cradle itself in illusions. According to them the rate
of wages in the country, still very low, has within the last 20 years risen
50-60 per cent., and stands now, on the average, at 6s. to 9s. per week. But
behind this apparent rise, is hidden an actual fall in wages, for it does not
correspond at all to the rise in price of the necessary means of subsistence
that has taken place in the meantime. For proof, the following extract from the
official accounts of an Irish workhouse. </span></p>

were 20 years before. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Even apart from this disproportion, the mere
comparison of the rate of wages expressed in gold would give a result far from
accurate. Before the famine, the great mass of agricultural wages were paid in
kind, only the smallest part in money; today, payment in money is the rule.
From this it follows that, whatever the amount of the real wage, its money rate
must rise.</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Previous to
the famine, the labourer enjoyed his cabin ... with a rood, or half-acre or
acre of land, and facilities for ... a crop of potatoes. He was able to rear

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In fact, formerly, the agricultural labourers
were but the smallest of the small farmers, and formed for the most part a kind
of rear-guard of the medium and large farms on which they found employment.
Only since the catastrophe of 1846 have they begun to form a fraction of the
class of purely wage labourers, a special class, connected with its
wage-masters only by monetary relations. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We know what were the conditions of their
dwellings in 1846. Since then they have grown yet worse. A part of the
agricultural labourers, which, however, grows less day by day, dwells still on
the holdings of the farmers in over-crowded huts, whose hideousness far
surpasses the worst that the English agricultural labourers offered us in this
way. And this holds generally with the exception of certain tracts of Ulster; in
the south, in the counties of Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny, &amp;c.; in the east,
in Wicklow, Wexford, &amp;c.; in the centre of Ireland, in King’s and Queen’s
County, Dublin, &amp;c.; in the west, in Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The first act of the agricultural revolution was
to sweep away the huts situated on the field of labour. This was done on the
largest scale, and as if in obedience to a command from on high. Thus many
labourers were compelled to seek shelter in villages and towns. There they were
thrown like refuse into garrets, holes, cellars and corners, in the worst back
slums. Thousands of Irish families, who according to the testimony of the
English, eaten up as these are with national prejudice, are notable for their
rare attachment to the domestic hearth, for their gaiety and the purity of
their home-life, found themselves suddenly transplanted into hotbeds of vice.
The men are now obliged to seek work of the neighbouring farmers and are only
hired by the day, and therefore under the most precarious form of wage. Hence</span></p>

the change of arable into pasture land, the use of machinery, the most rigorous

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The uncertainty and irregularity of employment,
the constant return and long duration of gluts of labour, all these symptoms of
a relative surplus population, figure therefore in the reports of the Poor Law
administration, as so many hardships of the agricultural proletariat. It will
be remembered that we met, in the English agricultural proletariat, with a
similar spectacle. But the difference is that in England, an industrial
country, the industrial reserve recruits itself from the country districts,
whilst in Ireland, an agricultural country, the agricultural reserve recruits
itself from the towns, the cities of refuge of the expelled agricultural
labourers. In the former, the supernumeraries of agriculture are transformed
into factory operatives; in the latter, those forced into the towns, whilst at
the same time they press on the wages in towns, remain agricultural labourers,
and are constantly sent back to the country districts in search of work. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The official inspectors sum up the material
condition of the agricultural labourer as follows:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“Though
living with the strictest frugality, his own wages are barely sufficient to
provide food for an ordinary family and pay his rent” and he depends upon other
sources for the means of clothing himself, his wife, and children.... The
atmosphere of these cabins, combined with the other privations they are
subjected to, has made this class particularly susceptible to low fever and
pulmonary consumption.” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1023" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1023"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">138</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After this, it is no wonder that, according to
the unanimous testimony of the inspectors, a sombre discontent runs through the
ranks of this class, that they long for the return of the past, loathe the
present, despair of the future, give themselves up “to the evil influence of
agitators,” and have only one fixed idea, to emigrate to America. This is the
land of Cockaigne, into which the great Malthusian panacea, depopulation, has
transformed green Erin. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">What a happy life the Irish factory operative leads
one example will show:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“On my recent
visit to the North of Ireland,” says the English Factory Inspector, Robert
Baker, “I met with the following evidence of effort in an Irish skilled workman
to afford education to his children; and I give his evidence verbatim, as I
took it from his mouth. That he was a skilled factory hand, may be understood
when I say that he was employed on goods for the Manchester market. ‘Johnson. –
I am a beetler and work from 6 in the morning till 11 at night, from Monday to
Friday. Saturday we leave off at 6 p. m., and get three hours of it (for meals
and rest). I have five children in all. For this work I get 10s. 6d. a week; my
wife works here also, and gets 5s. a week. The oldest girl who is 12, minds the
house. She is also cook, and all the servant we have. She gets the young ones
ready for school. A girl going past the house wakes me at half past five in the
morning. My wife gets up and goes along with me. We get nothing (to eat) before
we come to work. The child of 12 takes care of the little children all the day,
and we get nothing till breakfast at eight. At eight we go home. We get tea
once a week; at other times we get stirabout, sometimes of oat-meal, sometimes
of Indian meal, as we are able to get it. In the winter we get a little sugar
and water to our Indian meal. In the summer we get a few potatoes, planting a
small patch ourselves; and when they are done we get back to stirabout.
Sometimes we get a little milk as it may be. So we go on from day to day,
Sunday and week day, always the same the year round. I am always very much
tired when I have done at night. We may see a bit of flesh meat sometimes, but
very seldom. Three of our children attend school, for whom we pay 1d. a week a
head. Our rent is 9d. a week. Peat for firing costs 1s. 6d. a fortnight at the
very lowest.’” <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1024" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1024"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">139</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Such are Irish wages, such is Irish life! </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In fact the misery of Ireland is again the topic
of the day in England. At the end of 1866 and the beginning of 1867, one of the
Irish land magnates, Lord Dufferin, set about its solution in <i class="calibre4">The Times.</i>
“</span><span lang="DE">Wie menschlich von solch grossem Herrn</span><span lang="EN-GB">!” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From Table E. we saw that, during 1864, of
£4,368,610 of total profits, three surplus-value makers pocketed only £262,819;
that in 1865, however, out of £4,669,979 total profits, the same three virtuosi
of “abstinence” pocketed £274,528; in 1864, 26 surplus-value makers reached to
£646,377; in 1865, 28 surplus-value makers reached to £736,448; in 1864, 121 surplus-value
makers, £1,076,912; in 1865, 150 surplus-value makers, £1,320,906; in 1864,
1,131 surplus-value makers £2,150,818, nearly half of the total annual profit;
in 1865, 1,194 surplus-value makers, £2,418,833, more than half of the total
annual profit. But the lion’s share, which an inconceivably small number of
land magnates in England, Scotland and Ireland swallow up of the yearly
national rental, is so monstrous that the wisdom of the English State does not
think fit to afford the same statistical materials about the distribution of
rents as about the distribution of profits. Lord Dufferin is one of those land
magnates. That rent-rolls and profits can ever be “excessive,” or that their
plethora is in any way connected with plethora of the people’s misery is, of
course, an idea as “disreputable” as “unsound.” He keeps to facts. The fact is
that, as the Irish population diminishes, the Irish rent-rolls swell; that
depopulation benefits the landlords, therefore also benefits the soil, and,
therefore, the people, that mere accessory of the soil. He declares, therefore,
that Ireland is still over-populated, and the stream of emigration still flows
too lazily. To be perfectly happy, Ireland must get rid of at least one-third
of a million of labouring men. Let no man imagine that this lord, poetic into
the bargain, is a physician of the school of Sangrado, who as often as he did
not find his patient better, ordered phlebotomy and again phlebotomy, until the
patient lost his sickness at the same time as his blood. Lord Dufferin demands
a new blood-letting of one-third of a million only, instead of about two
millions; in fact, without the getting rid of these, the millennium in Erin is
not to be. The proof is easily given. </span></p>

1,709,532. And as l’appétit vient en mangeant, Rentroll’s eyes will soon
