Accumulation</span></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We have seen how money is changed into capital;
how through capital surplus-value is made, and from surplus-value more capital.
But the accumulation of capital presupposes surplus-value; surplus-value
presupposes capitalistic production; capitalistic production presupposes the
pre-existence of considerable masses of capital and of labour power in the
hands of producers of commodities. The whole movement, therefore, seems to turn
in a vicious circle, out of which we can only get by supposing a primitive
accumulation (previous accumulation of Adam Smith) preceding capitalistic
accumulation; an accumulation not the result of the capitalistic mode of
production, but its starting point.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This primitive accumulation plays in Political
Economy about the same part as original sin in theology. Adam bit the apple,
and thereupon sin fell on the human race. Its origin is supposed to be
explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past. In times long gone by
there were two sorts of people; one, the diligent, intelligent, and, above all,
frugal elite; the other, lazy rascals, spending their substance, and more, in
riotous living. The legend of theological original sin tells us certainly how
man came to be condemned to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow; but the
history of economic original sin reveals to us that there are people to whom
this is by no means essential. Never mind! Thus it came to pass that the former
sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except
their own skins. And from this original sin dates the poverty of the great
majority that, despite all its labour, has up to now nothing to sell but
itself, and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have
long ceased to work. Such insipid childishness is every day preached to us in
the defence of property. M. Thiers, <i class="calibre4">e.g</i>., had the assurance to repeat it
with all the solemnity of a statesman to the French people, once so <i class="calibre4">spirituel</i>.
But as soon as the question of property crops up, it becomes a sacred duty to
proclaim the intellectual food of the infant as the one thing fit for all ages
and for all stages of development. In actual history it is notorious that
conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly force, play the great part. In
the tender annals of Political Economy, the idyllic reigns from time
immemorial. Right and “labour” were from all time the sole means of enrichment,
the present year of course always excepted. As a matter of fact, the methods of
primitive accumulation are anything but idyllic.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In themselves money and commodities are no more
capital than are the means of production and of subsistence. They want
transforming into capital. But this transformation itself can only take place
under certain circumstances that centre in this, viz., that two very different
kinds of commodity-possessors must come face to face and into contact; on the
one hand, the owners of money, means of production, means of subsistence, who
are eager to increase the sum of values they possess, by buying other people’s
labour power; on the other hand, free labourers, the sellers of their own
labour power, and therefore the sellers of labour. Free labourers, in the
double sense that neither they themselves form part and parcel of the means of
production, as in the case of slaves, bondsmen, &amp;c., nor do the means of
production belong to them, as in the case of peasant-proprietors; they are,
therefore, free from, unencumbered by, any means of production of their own.
With this polarisation of the market for commodities, the fundamental conditions
of capitalist production are given. The capitalist system presupposes the
complete separation of the labourers from all property in the means by which
they can realize their labour. As soon as capitalist production is once on its
own legs, it not only maintains this separation, but reproduces it on a
continually extending scale. The process, therefore, that clears the way for
the capitalist system, can be none other than the process which takes away from
the labourer the possession of his means of production; a process that
transforms, on the one hand, the social means of subsistence and of production
into capital, on the other, the immediate producers into wage labourers. The
so-called primitive accumulation, therefore, is nothing else than the historical
process of divorcing the producer from the means of production. It appears as
primitive, because it forms the prehistoric stage of capital and of the mode of
production corresponding with it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The economic structure of capitalist society has
grown out of the economic structure of feudal society. The dissolution of the
latter set free the elements of the former.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The immediate producer, the labourer, could only
dispose of his own person after he had ceased to be attached to the soil and
ceased to be the slave, serf, or bondsman of another. To become a free seller
of labour power, who carries his commodity wherever he finds a market, he must
further have escaped from the regime of the guilds, their rules for apprentices
and journeymen, and the impediments of their labour regulations. Hence, the
historical movement which changes the producers into wage-workers, appears, on
the one hand, as their emancipation from serfdom and from the fetters of the
guilds, and this side alone exists for our bourgeois historians. But, on the
other hand, these new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had
been robbed of all their own means of production, and of all the guarantees of
existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements. And the history of this, their
expropriation, is written in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and
fire.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The industrial capitalists, these new
potentates, had on their part not only to displace the guild masters of
handicrafts, but also the feudal lords, the possessors of the sources of
wealth. In this respect, their conquest of social power appears as the fruit of
a victorious struggle both against feudal lordship and its revolting
prerogatives, and against the guilds and the fetters they laid on the free
development of production and the free exploitation of man by man. The
chevaliers d’industrie, however, only succeeded in supplanting the chevaliers
of the sword by making use of events of which they themselves were wholly
innocent. They have risen by means as vile as those by which the Roman freedman
once on a time made himself the master of his <i class="calibre4">patronus</i>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The starting point of the development that gave
rise to the wage labourer as well as to the capitalist, was the servitude of
the labourer. The advance consisted in a change of form of this servitude, in
the transformation of feudal exploitation into capitalist exploitation. To
understand its march, we need not go back very far. Although we come across the
first beginnings of capitalist production as early as the 14th or 15th century,
sporadically, in certain towns of the Mediterranean, the capitalistic era dates
from the 16th century. Wherever it appears, the abolition of serfdom has been
long effected, and the highest development of the middle ages, the existence of
sovereign towns, has been long on the wane.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the history of primitive accumulation, all
revolutions are epoch-making that act as levers for the capital class in course
of formation; but, above all, those moments when great masses of men are
suddenly and forcibly torn from their means of subsistence, and hurled as free
and “unattached” proletarians on the labour-market. The expropriation of the
agricultural producer, of the peasant, from the soil, is the basis of the whole
process. The history of this expropriation, in different countries, assumes
different aspects, and runs through its various phases in different orders of
succession, and at different periods. In England alone, which we take as our
example, has it the classic form. <a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1027" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1027"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a><span class="EndnoteCharacters"></span></span></p>
