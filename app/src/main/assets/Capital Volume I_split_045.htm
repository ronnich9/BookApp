<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In England, serfdom had practically disappeared
in the last part of the 14th century. The immense majority of the population</span><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1028" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1028"><span class="EndnoteCharacters"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre12">1</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> consisted then, and to a still larger extent, in the
15th century, of free peasant proprietors, whatever was the feudal title under
which their right of property was hidden. In the larger seignorial domains, the
old bailiff, himself a serf, was displaced by the free farmer. The wage
labourers of agriculture consisted partly of peasants, who utilised their
leisure time by working on the large estates, partly of an independent special
class of wage labourers, relatively and absolutely few in numbers. The latter
also were practically at the same time peasant farmers, since, besides their
wages, they had allotted to them arable land to the extent of 4 or more acres,
together with their cottages. Besides they, with the rest of the peasants,
enjoyed the usufruct of the common land, which gave pasture to their cattle,
furnished them with timber, fire-wood, turf, &amp;c.</span><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1029" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1029"><span class="EndnoteCharacters"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre12">2</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> In all countries of Europe, feudal production is
characterised by division of the soil amongst the greatest possible number of
subfeudatories. The might of the feudal lord, like that of the sovereign,
depended not on the length of his rent roll, but on the number of his subjects,
and the latter depended on the number of peasant proprietors.</span><a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1030" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1030"><span class="EndnoteCharacters"><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre12">3</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> Although, therefore, the English land, after the
Norman Conquest, was distributed in gigantic baronies, one of which often
included some 900 of the old Anglo-Saxon lordships, it was bestrewn with small
peasant properties, only here and there interspersed with great seignorial
domains. Such conditions, together with the prosperity of the towns so
characteristic of the 15th century, allowed of that wealth of the people which
Chancellor Fortescue so eloquently paints in his “Laudes legum Angliae;” but it
excluded the possibility of capitalistic wealth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The prelude of the revolution that laid the
foundation of the capitalist mode of production, was played in the last third
of the 15th, and the first decade of the 16th century. A mass of free
proletarians was hurled on the labour market by the breaking-up of the bands of
feudal retainers, who, as Sir James Steuart well says, “everywhere uselessly
filled house and castle.” Although the royal power, itself a product of
bourgeois development, in its strife after absolute sovereignty forcibly
hastened on the dissolution of these bands of retainers, it was by no means the
sole cause of it. In insolent conflict with king and parliament, the great
feudal lords created an incomparably larger proletariat by the forcible driving
of the peasantry from the land, to which the latter had the same feudal right
as the lord himself, and by the usurpation of the common lands. The rapid rise
of the Flemish wool manufactures, and the corresponding rise in the price of
wool in England, gave the direct impulse to these evictions. The old nobility
had been devoured by the great feudal wars. The new nobility was the child of
its time, for which money was the power of all powers. Transformation of arable
land into sheep-walks was, therefore, its cry. Harrison, in his “Description of
England, prefixed to Holinshed’s Chronicles,” describes how the expropriation
of small peasants is ruining the country. “What care our great encroachers?”
The dwellings of the peasants and the cottages of the labourers were razed to
the ground or doomed to decay. “If,” says Harrison, “the old records of euerie
manour be sought... it will soon appear that in some manour seventeene,
eighteene, or twentie houses are shrunk... that England was neuer less
furnished with people than at the present... Of cities and townes either
utterly decaied or more than a quarter or half diminished, though some one be a
little increased here or there; of townes pulled downe for sheepe-walks, and no
more but the lordships now standing in them... I could saie somewhat.” The
complaints of these old chroniclers are always exaggerated, but they reflect
faithfully the impression made on contemporaries by the revolution in the
conditions of production. A comparison of the writings of Chancellor Fortescue
and Thomas More reveals the gulf between the 15th and 16th century. As Thornton
rightly has it, the English working class was precipitated without any
transition from its golden into its iron age.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Legislation was terrified at this revolution. It
did not yet stand on that height of civilisation where the “wealth of the
nation” (i.e., the formation of capital, and the reckless exploitation and impoverishing
of the mass of the people) figure as the <i class="calibre4">ultima Thule</i> of all
state-craft. In his history of Henry VII., Bacon says: “Inclosures at that time
(1489) began to be more frequent, whereby arable land (which could not be
manured without people and families) was turned into pasture, which was easily
rid by a few herdsmen; and tenancies for years, lives, and at will (whereupon
much of the yeomanry lived) were turned into demesnes. This bred a decay of
people, and (by consequence) a decay of towns, churches, tithes, and the
like... In remedying of this inconvenience the king’s wisdom was admirable, and
the parliament’s at that time... they took a course to take away depopulating
enclosures, and depopulating pasturage.” An Act of Henry VII., 1489, cap. 19, forbad
the destruction of all “houses of husbandry” to which at least 20 acres of land
belonged. By an Act, 25 Henry VIII., the same law was renewed. It recites,
among other things, that many farms and large flocks of cattle, especially of
sheep, are concentrated in the hands of a few men, whereby the rent of land has
much risen and tillage has fallen off, churches and houses have been pulled
down, and marvellous numbers of people have been deprived of the means
wherewith to maintain themselves and their families. The Act, therefore,
ordains the rebuilding of the decayed farmsteads, and fixes a proportion
between corn land and pasture land, &amp;c. An Act of 1533 recites that some
owners possess 24,000 sheep, and limits the number to be owned to 2,000.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1031" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1031"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a> The cry of the people and the legislation
directed, for 150 years after Henry VII., against the expropriation of the
small farmers and peasants, were alike fruitless. The secret of their
inefficiency Bacon, without knowing it, reveals to us. “The device of King Henry
VII.,” says Bacon, in his “Essays, Civil and Moral,” Essay 29, “was profound
and admirable, in making farms and houses of husbandry of a standard; that is,
maintained with such a proportion of land unto them as may breed a subject to
live in convenient plenty, and no servile condition, and to keep the plough in
the hands of the owners and not mere hirelings.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1032" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1032"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a>
What the capitalist system demanded was, on the other hand, a degraded and
almost servile condition of the mass of the people, the transformation of them
into mercenaries, and of their means of labour into capital. During this
transformation period, legislation also strove to retain the 4 acres of land by
the cottage of the agricultural wage labourer, and forbad him to take lodgers
into his cottage. In the reign of James I., 1627, Roger Crocker of Front Mill,
was condemned for having built a cottage on the manor of Front Mill without 4
acres of land attached to the same in perpetuity. As late as Charles I.’s
reign, 1638, a royal commission was appointed to enforce the carrying out of
the old laws, especially that referring to the 4 acres of land. Even in
Cromwell’s time, the building of a house within 4 miles of London was forbidden
unless it was endowed with 4 acres of land. As late as the first half of the
18th century complaint is made if the cottage of the agricultural labourer has
not an adjunct of one or two acres of land. Nowadays he is lucky if it is
furnished with a little garden, or if he may rent, far away from his cottage, a
few roods. “Landlords and farmers,” says Dr. Hunter, “work here hand in hand. A
few acres to the cottage would make the labourers too independent.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1033" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1033"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The process of forcible expropriation of the
people received in the 16th century a new and frightful impulse from the Reformation,
and from the consequent colossal spoliation of the church property. The
Catholic church was, at the time of the Reformation, feudal proprietor of a
great part of the English land. The suppression of the monasteries, &amp;c.,
hurled their inmates into the proletariat. The estates of the church were to a
large extent given away to rapacious royal favourites, or sold at a nominal
price to speculating farmers and citizens, who drove out, <i class="calibre4">en masse,</i> the
hereditary sub-tenants and threw their holdings into one. The legally
guaranteed property of the poorer folk in a part of the church’s tithes was
tacitly confiscated.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1034" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1034"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a> “Pauper
ubique jacet,” cried Queen Elizabeth, after a journey through England. In the
43rd year of her reign the nation was obliged to recognise pauperism officially
by the introduction of a poor-rate. “The authors of this law seem to have been
ashamed to state the grounds of it, for [contrary to traditional usage] it has
no preamble whatever.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1035" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1035"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a> By the
16th of Charles I., ch. 4, it was declared perpetual, and in fact only in 1834
did it take a new and harsher form.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1036" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1036"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">9</span></a>
These immediate results of the Reformation were not its most lasting ones. The
property of the church formed the religious bulwark of the traditional
conditions of landed property. With its fall these were no longer tenable.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1037" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1037"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">10</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Even in the last decade of the 17th century, the
yeomanry, the class of independent peasants, were more numerous than the class
of farmers. They had formed the backbone of Cromwell’s strength, and, even
according to the confession of Macaulay, stood in favourable contrast to the
drunken squires and to their servants, the country clergy, who had to marry
their masters’ cast-off mistresses. About 1750, the yeomanry had disappeared,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1038" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1038"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">11</span></a> and so had, in the last decade of the
18th century, the last trace of the common land of the agricultural labourer.
We leave on one side here the purely economic causes of the agricultural
revolution. We deal only with the forcible means employed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After the restoration of the Stuarts, the landed
proprietors carried, by legal means, an act of usurpation, effected everywhere
on the Continent without any legal formality. They abolished the feudal tenure
of land, <i class="calibre4">i.e.</i>, they got rid of all its obligations to the State,
“indemnified” the State by taxes on the peasantry and the rest of the mass of
the people, vindicated for themselves the rights of modern private property in
estates to which they had only a feudal title, and, finally, passed those laws
of settlement, which, <i class="calibre4">mutatis mutandis</i>, had the same effect on the
English agricultural labourer, as the edict of the Tartar Boris Godunof on the
Russian peasantry. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The “glorious Revolution” brought into power,
along with William of Orange, the landlord and capitalist appropriators of surplus-value.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1039" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1039"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">12</span></a> They inaugurated the new era by
practising on a colossal scale thefts of state lands, thefts that had been
hitherto managed more modestly. These estates were given away, sold at a
ridiculous figure, or even annexed to private estates by direct seizure.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1040" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1040"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">13</span></a> All this happened without the slightest
observation of legal etiquette. The Crown lands thus fraudulently appropriated,
together with the robbery of the Church estates, as far as these had not been
lost again during the republican revolution, form the basis of the today
princely domains of the English oligarchy.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1041" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1041"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">14</span></a>
The bourgeois capitalists favoured the operation with the view, among others,
to promoting free trade in land, to extending the domain of modern agriculture
on the large farm-system, and to increasing their supply of the free
agricultural proletarians ready to hand. Besides, the new landed aristocracy
was the natural ally of the new bankocracy, of the newly-hatched <i class="calibre4">haute
finance,</i> and of the large manufacturers, then depending on protective duties.
The English bourgeoisie acted for its own interest quite as wisely as did the
Swedish bourgeoisie who, reversing the process, hand in hand with their
economic allies, the peasantry, helped the kings in the forcible resumption of
the Crown lands from the oligarchy. This happened since 1604 under Charles X.
and Charles XI. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Communal property – always distinct from the
State property just dealt with – was an old Teutonic institution which lived on
under cover of feudalism. We have seen how the forcible usurpation of this,
generally accompanied by the turning of arable into pasture land, begins at the
end of the 15th and extends into the 16th century. But, at that time, the
process was carried on by means of individual acts of violence against which
legislation, for a hundred and fifty years, fought in vain. The advance made by
the 18th century shows itself in this, that the law itself becomes now the
instrument of the theft of the people’s land, although the large farmers make
use of their little independent methods as well.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1042" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1042"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">15</span></a>
The parliamentary form of the robbery is that of Acts for enclosures of
Commons, in other words, decrees by which the landlords grant themselves the
people’s land as private property, decrees of expropriation of the people. Sir
F. M. Eden refutes his own crafty special pleading, in which he tries to
represent communal property as the private property of the great landlords who
have taken the place of the feudal lords, when he, himself, demands a “general
Act of Parliament for the enclosure of Commons” (admitting thereby that a
parliamentary <i class="calibre4">coup d’état</i> is necessary for its transformation into
private property), and moreover calls on the legislature for the
indemnification for the expropriated poor.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1043" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1043"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">16</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Whilst the place of the independent yeoman was
taken by tenants at will, small farmers on yearly leases, a servile rabble
dependent on the pleasure of the landlords, the systematic robbery of the
Communal lands helped especially, next to the theft of the State domains, to
swell those large farms, that were called in the 18th century capital farms<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1044" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1044"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">17</span></a> or merchant farms,<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1045" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1045"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">18</span></a> and to “set free” the agricultural
population as proletarians for manufacturing industry.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The 18th century, however, did not yet recognise
as fully as the 19th, the identity between national wealth and the poverty of
the people. Hence the most vigorous polemic, in the economic literature of that
time, on the “enclosure of commons.” From the mass of materials that lie before
me, I give a few extracts that will throw a strong light on the circumstances
of the time. “In several parishes of Hertfordshire,” writes one indignant
person, “24 farms, numbering on the average 50-150 acres, have been melted up
into three farms.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1046" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1046"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">19</span></a> “In
Northamptonshire and Leicestershire the enclosure of common lands has taken
place on a very large scale, and most of the new lordships, resulting from the
enclosure, have been turned into pasturage, in consequence of which many
lordships have not now 50 acres ploughed yearly, in which 1,500 were ploughed
formerly. The ruins of former dwelling-houses, barns, stables, &amp;c.,” are
the sole traces of the former inhabitants. “An hundred houses and families have
in some open-field villages dwindled to eight or ten.... The landholders in
most parishes that have been enclosed only 15 or 20 years, are very few in
comparison of the numbers who occupied them in their open-field state. It is no
uncommon thing for 4 or 5 wealthy graziers to engross a large enclosed lordship
which was before in the hands of 20 or 30 farmers, and as many smaller tenants
and proprietors. All these are hereby thrown out of their livings with their
families and many other families who were chiefly employed and supported by
them.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1047" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1047"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">20</span></a> It was not only the land
that lay waste, but often land cultivated either in common or held under a
definite rent paid to the community, that was annexed by the neighbouring
landlords under pretext of enclosure. “I have here in view enclosures of open
fields and lands already improved. It is acknowledged by even the writers in
defence of enclosures that these diminished villages increase the monopolies of
farms, raise the prices of provisions, and produce depopulation ... and even
the enclosure of waste lands (as now carried on) bears hard on the poor, by
depriving them of a part of their subsistence, and only goes towards increasing
farms already too large.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1048" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1048"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">21</span></a> “When,”
says Dr. Price, “this land gets into the hands of a few great farmers, the
consequence must be that the little farmers” (earlier designated by him “a
multitude of little proprietors and tenants, who maintain themselves and
families by the produce of the ground they occupy by sheep kept on a common, by
poultry, hogs, &amp;c., and who therefore have little occasion to purchase any
of the means of subsistence”) “will be converted into a body of men who earn
their subsistence by working for others, and who will be under a necessity of
going to market for all they want.... There will, perhaps, be more labour,
because there will be more compulsion to it.... Towns and manufactures will
increase, because more will be driven to them in quest of places and
employment. This is the way in which the engrossing of farms naturally
operates. And this is the way in which, for many years, it has been actually
operating in this kingdom.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1049" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1049"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">22</span></a> He sums
up the effect of the enclosures thus: “Upon the whole, the circumstances of the
lower ranks of men are altered in almost every respect for the worse. From
little occupiers of land, they are reduced to the state of day-labourers and
hirelings; and, at the same time, their subsistence in that state has become
more difficult.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1050" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1050"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">23</span></a> In
fact, usurpation of the common lands and the revolution in agriculture
accompanying this, told so acutely on the agricultural labourers that, even
according to Eden, between 1765 and 1780, their wages began to fall below the
minimum, and to be supplemented by official poor-law relief. Their wages, he
says, “were not more than enough for the absolute necessaries of life.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us hear for a moment a defender of
enclosures and an opponent of Dr. Price. “Not is it a consequence that there
must be depopulation, because men are not seen wasting their labour in the open
field.... If, by converting the little farmers into a body of men who must work
for others, more labour is produced, it is an advantage which the nation” (to
which, of course, the “converted” ones do not belong) “should wish for ... the
produce being greater when their joint labours are employed on one farm, there
will be a surplus for manufactures, and by this means manufactures, one of the
mines of the nation, will increase, in proportion to the quantity of corn
produced.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1051" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1051"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">24</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The stoical peace of mind with which the
political economist regards the most shameless violation of the “sacred rights
of property” and the grossest acts of violence to persons, as soon as they are
necessary to lay the foundations of the capitalistic mode of production, is
shown by Sir F. M. Eden, philanthropist and tory to boot. The whole series of
thefts, outrages, and popular misery, that accompanied the forcible
expropriation of the people, from the last third of the 15th to the end of the
18th century, lead him merely to the comfortable conclusion: “The due
proportion between arable land and pasture had to be established. During the whole
of the 14th and the greater part of the 15th century, there was one acre of
pasture to 2, 3, and even 4 of arable land. About the middle of the 16th
century the proportion was changed of 2 acres of pasture to 2, later on, of 2
acres of pasture to one of arable, until at last the just proportion of 3 acres
of pasture to one of arable land was attained.” </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the 19th century, the very memory of the
connexion between the agricultural labourer and the communal property had, of
course, vanished. To say nothing of more recent times, have the agricultural
population received a farthing of compensation for the 3,511,770 acres of
common land which between 1801 and 1831 were stolen from them and by
parliamentary devices presented to the landlords by the landlords?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The last process of wholesale expropriation of
the agricultural population from the soil is, finally, the so-called clearing
of estates, <i class="calibre4">i.e.</i>, the sweeping men off them. All the English methods
hitherto considered culminated in “clearing.” As we saw in the picture of
modern conditions given in a former chapter, where there are no more
independent peasants to get rid of, the “clearing” of cottages begins; so that
the agricultural labourers do not find on the soil cultivated by them even the
spot necessary for their own housing. But what “clearing of estates” really and
properly signifies, we learn only in the promised land of modern romance, the
Highlands of Scotland. There the process is distinguished by its systematic
character, by the magnitude of the scale on which it is carried out at one blow
(in Ireland landlords have gone to the length of sweeping away several villages
at once; in Scotland areas as large as German principalities are dealt with),
finally by the peculiar form of property, under which the embezzled lands were
held. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Highland Celts were organised in clans, each
of which was the owner of the land on which it was settled. The representative
of the clan, its chief or “great man,” was only the titular owner of this
property, just as the Queen of England is the titular owner of all the national
soil. When the English government succeeded in suppressing the intestine wars
of these “great men,” and their constant incursions into the Lowland plains,
the chiefs of the clans by no means gave up their time-honoured trade as
robbers; they only changed its form. On their own authority they transformed
their nominal right into a right of private property, and as this brought them
into collision with their clansmen, resolved to drive them out by open force.
“A king of England might as well claim to drive his subjects into the sea,”
says Professor Newman.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1052" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1052"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">25</span></a> This
revolution, which began in Scotland after the last rising of the followers of
the Pretender, can be followed through its first phases in the writings of Sir
James Steuart<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1053" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1053"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">26</span></a><span>  </span>and James Anderson.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1054" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1054"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">27</span></a> In the 18th century the hunted-out Gaels
were forbidden to emigrate from the country, with a view to driving them by
force to Glasgow and other manufacturing towns.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1055" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1055"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">28</span></a>
As an example of the method<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1056" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1056"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">29</span></a><span>  </span>obtaining in the 19th century, the “clearing”
made by the Duchess of Sutherland will suffice here. This person, well
instructed in economy, resolved, on entering upon her government, to effect a
radical cure, and to turn the whole country, whose population had already been,
by earlier processes of the like kind, reduced to 15,000, into a sheep-walk.
From 1814 to 1820 these 15,000 inhabitants, about 3,000 families, were
systematically hunted and rooted out. All their villages were destroyed and
burnt, all their fields turned into pasturage. British soldiers enforced this
eviction, and came to blows with the inhabitants. One old woman was burnt to
death in the flames of the hut, which she refused to leave. Thus this fine lady
appropriated 794,000 acres of land that had from time immemorial belonged to
the clan. She assigned to the expelled inhabitants about 6,000 acres on the
sea-shore – 2 acres per family. The 6,000 acres had until this time lain waste,
and brought in no income to their owners. The Duchess, in the nobility of her
heart, actually went so far as to let these at an average rent of 2s. 6d. per
acre to the clansmen, who for centuries had shed their blood for her family.
The whole of the stolen clanland she divided into 29 great sheep farms, each
inhabited by a single family, for the most part imported English farm-servants.
In the year 1835 the 15,000 Gaels were already replaced by 131,000 sheep. The
remnant of the aborigines flung on the sea-shore tried to live by catching
fish. They became amphibious and lived, as an English author says, half on land
and half on water, and withal only half on both.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1057" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1057"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">30</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But the brave Gaels must expiate yet more
bitterly their idolatry, romantic and of the mountains, for the “great men” of
the clan. The smell of their fish rose to the noses of the great men. They
scented some profit in it, and let the sea-shore to the great fishmongers of
London. For the second time the Gaels were hunted out.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1058" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1058"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">31</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But, finally, part of the sheep-walks are turned
into deer preserves. Every one knows that there are no real forests in England.
The deer in the parks of the great are demurely domestic cattle, fat as London
aldermen. Scotland is therefore the last refuge of the “noble passion.” “In the
Highlands,” says Somers in 1848, “new forests are springing up like mushrooms.
Here, on one side of Gaick, you have the new forest of Glenfeshie; and there on
the other you have the new forest of Ardverikie. In the same line you have the
Black Mount, an immense waste also recently erected. From east to west – from
the neighbourhood of Aberdeen to the crags of Oban – you have now a continuous
line of forests; while in other parts of the Highlands there are the new
forests of Loch Archaig, Glengarry, Glenmoriston, &amp;c. Sheep were introduced
into glens which had been the seats of communities of small farmers; and the
latter were driven to seek subsistence on coarser and more sterile tracks of
soil. Now deer are supplanting sheep; and these are once more dispossessing the
small tenants, who will necessarily be driven down upon still coarser land and
to more grinding penury. Deer-forests<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1059" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1059"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">32</span></a>
and the people cannot co-exist. One or other of the two must yield. Let the
forests be increased in number and extent during the next quarter of a century,
as they have been in the last, and the Gaels will perish from their native
soil... This movement among the Highland proprietors is with some a matter of
ambition... with some love of sport... while others, of a more practical cast,
follow the trade in deer with an eye solely to profit. For it is a fact, that a
mountain range laid out in forest is, in many cases, more profitable to the
proprietor than when let as a sheep-walk. ... The huntsman who wants a
deer-forest limits his offers by no other calculation than the extent of his
purse.... Sufferings have been inflicted in the Highlands scarcely less severe
than those occasioned by the policy of the Norman kings. Deer have received
extended ranges, while men have been hunted within a narrower and still
narrower circle.... One after one the liberties of the people have been cloven
down.... And the oppressions are daily on the increase.... The clearance and
dispersion of the people is pursued by the proprietors as a settled principle,
as an agricultural necessity, just as trees and brushwood are cleared from the
wastes of America or Australia; and the operation goes on in a quiet,
business-like way, &amp;c.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1060" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1060"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">33</span></a> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The spoliation of the church’s property, the
fraudulent alienation of the State domains, the robbery of the common lands,
the usurpation of feudal and clan property, and its transformation into modern
private property under circumstances of reckless terrorism, were just so many
idyllic methods of primitive accumulation. They conquered the field for
capitalistic agriculture, made the soil part and parcel of capital, and created
for the town industries the necessary supply of a “free” and outlawed
proletariat.</span></p>
