Revolution on Industry. Creation of the Home-Market for Industrial Capital</span></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The expropriation and expulsion of the
agricultural population, intermittent but renewed again and again, supplied, as
we saw, the town industries with a mass of proletarians entirely unconnected
with the corporate guilds and unfettered by them; a fortunate circumstance that
makes old A. Anderson (not to be confounded with James Anderson), in his
“History of Commerce,” believe in the direct intervention of Providence. We
must still pause a moment on this element of primitive accumulation. The
thinning-out of the independent, self-supporting peasants not only brought
about the crowding together of the industrial proletariat, in the way that
Geoffrey Saint Hilaire explained the condensation of cosmical matter at one
place, by its rarefaction at another.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1071" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1071"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a>
In spite of the smaller number of its cultivators, the soil brought forth as
much or more produce, after as before, because the revolution in the conditions
of landed property was accompanied by improved methods of culture, greater
co-operation, concentration of the means of production, &amp;c., and because
not only were the agricultural wage labourers put on the strain more intensely<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1072" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1072"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">2</span></a>, but the field of production on which they
worked for themselves became more and more contracted. With the setting free of
a part of the agricultural population, therefore, their former means of
nourishment were also set free. They were now transformed into material
elements of variable capital. The peasant, expropriated and cast adrift, must
buy their value in the form of wages, from his new master, the industrial
capitalist. That which holds good of the means of subsistence holds with the
raw materials of industry dependent upon home agriculture. They were
transformed into an element of constant capital. Suppose, <i class="calibre4">e.g</i>., a part
of the Westphalian peasants, who, at the time of Frederick II, all span flax,
forcibly expropriated and hunted from the soil; and the other part that remained,
turned into day labourers of large farmers. At the same time arise large
establishments for flax-spinning and weaving, in which the men “set free” now
work for wages. The flax looks exactly as before. Not a fibre of it is changed,
but a new social soul has popped into its body. It forms now a part of the
constant capital of the master manufacturer. Formerly divided among a number of
small producers, who cultivated it themselves and with their families spun it
in retail fashion, it is now concentrated in the hand of one capitalist, who
sets others to spin and weave it for him. The extra labour expended in
flax-spinning realised itself formerly in extra income to numerous peasant
families, or maybe, in Frederick II’s time, in taxes pour le roi de Prusse. It
realises itself now in profit for a few capitalists. The spindles and looms,
formerly scattered over the face of the country, are now crowded together in a
few great labour-barracks, together with the labourers and the raw material.
And spindles, looms, raw material, are now transformed from means of
independent existence for the spinners and weavers, into means for commanding
them and sucking out of them unpaid labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1073" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1073"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">3</span></a>
One does not perceive, when looking at the large manufactories and the large
farms, that they have originated from the throwing into one of many small
centres of production, and have been built up by the expropriation of many
small independent producers. Nevertheless, the popular intuition was not at
fault. In the time of Mirabeau, the lion of the Revolution, the great
manufactories were still called manufactures réunies, workshops thrown into
one, as we speak of fields thrown into one. Says Mirabeau:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN-GB">“We are only
paying attention to the grand manufactories, in which hundreds of men work
under a director and which are commonly called <i class="calibre4">manufactures réunies</i>.
Those where a very large number of labourers work, each separately and on his
own account, are hardly considered; they are placed at an infinite distance
from the others. This is a great error, as the latter alone make a really
important object of national prosperity.... The large workshop (manufacture
réunie) will enrich prodigiously one or two entrepreneurs, but the labourers
will only be journeymen, paid more or less, and will not have any share in the
success of the undertaking. In the discrete workshop (manufacture separée), on
the contrary, no one will become rich, but many labourers will be comfortable;
the saving and the industrious will be able to amass a little capital, to put by
a little for a birth of a child, for an illness, for themselves or their
belongings. The number of saving and industrious labourers will increase,
because they will see in good conduct, in activity, a means of essentially
bettering their condition, and not of obtaining a small rise in wages that can
never be of any importance of the future, and whose sole result is to place men
in the position to live a little better, but only from day to day.... The large
workshops, undertakings of certain private persons who pay labourers from day
to day to work for their gain, may be able to put these private individuals at
their ease, but they will never be an object worth the attention of
governments. Discrete workshops, for the most part combined with cultivation of
small holdings, are the only free ones.”<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1074" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1074"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">4</span></a>
The expropriation and eviction of a part of the agricultural population not
only set free for industrial capital, the labourers, their means of
subsistence, and material for labour; it also created the home-market. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In fact, the events that transformed the small
peasants into wage labourers, and their means of subsistence and of labour into
material elements of capital, created, at the same time, a home-market for the
latter. Formerly, the peasant family produced the means of subsistence and the
raw materials, which they themselves, for the most part, consumed. These raw
materials and means of subsistence have now become commodities; the large
farmer sells them, he finds his market in manufactures. Yarn, linen, coarse
woollen stuffs – things whose raw materials had been within the reach of every
peasant family, had been spun and woven by it for its own use – were now
transformed into articles of manufacture, to which the country districts at
once served for markets. The many scattered customers, whom stray artisans
until now had found in the numerous small producers working on their own
account, concentrate themselves now into one great market provided for by
industrial capital.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1075" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1075"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">5</span></a> Thus,
hand in hand with the expropriation of the self-supporting peasants, with their
separation from their means of production, goes the destruction of rural
domestic industry, the process of separation between manufacture and
agriculture. And only the destruction of rural domestic industry can give the
internal market of a country that extension and consistence which the
capitalist mode of production requires. Still the manufacturing period,
properly so called, does not succeed in carrying out this transformation
radically and completely. It will be remembered that manufacture, properly so
called, conquers but partially the domain of national production, and always
rests on the handicrafts of the town and the domestic industry of the rural
districts as its ultimate basis. If it destroys these in one form, in
particular branches, at certain points, it calls them up again elsewhere,
because it needs them for the preparation of raw material up to a certain
point. It produces, therefore, a new class of small villagers who, while
following the cultivation of the soil as an accessory calling, find their chief
occupation in industrial labour, the products of which they sell to the
manufacturers directly, or through the medium of merchants. This is one, though
not the chief, cause of a phenomenon which, at first, puzzles the student of
English history.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1076" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1076"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">6</span></a> From the
last third of the 15th century he finds continually complaints, only
interrupted at certain intervals, about the encroachment of capitalist farming
in the country districts, and the progressive destruction of the peasantry. On
the other hand, he always finds this peasantry turning up again, although in
diminished number, and always under worse conditions. The chief reason is:
England is at one time chiefly a cultivator of corn, at another chiefly a breeder
of cattle, in alternate periods, </span>and with these the extent of peasant
cultivation fluctuates. Modern Industry alone, and finally, supplies, in
machinery,<span lang="EN-GB"> the lasting basis of capitalistic agriculture,
expropriates radically the enormous majority of the agricultural population,
and completes the separation between agriculture and rural domestic industry,
whose roots – spinning and weaving – it tears up.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1077" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1077"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">7</span></a>
It therefore also, for the first time, conquers for industrial capital the
entire home market.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1078" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1078"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">8</span></a> </span></p>
