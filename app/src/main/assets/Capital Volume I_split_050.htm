Accumulation</span></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">What does
the primitive accumulation of capital, <em class="calibre4">i.e</em>., its historical genesis,
resolve itself into? In so far as it is not immediate transformation of slaves
and serfs into wage labourers, and therefore a mere change of form, it only
means the expropriation of the immediate producers, <em class="calibre4">i.e</em>., the
dissolution of private property based on the labour of its owner. Private
property, as the antithesis to social, collective property, exists only where
the means of labour and the external conditions of labour belong to private
individuals. But according as these private individuals are labourers or not
labourers, private property has a different character. The numberless shades,
that it at first sight presents, correspond to the intermediate stages lying
between these two extremes. The private property of the labourer in his means
of production is the foundation of petty industry, whether agricultural,
manufacturing, or both; petty industry, again, is an essential condition for
the development of social production and of the free individuality of the
labourer himself. Of course, this petty mode of production exists also under
slavery, serfdom, and other states of dependence. But it flourishes, it lets
loose its whole energy, it attains its adequate classical form, only where the
labourer is the private owner of his own means of labour set in action by
himself: the peasant of the land which he cultivates, the artisan of the tool
which he handles as a virtuoso. This mode of production presupposes parcelling
of the soil and scattering of the other means of production. As it excludes the
concentration of these means of production, so also it excludes co-operation,
division of labour within each separate process of production, the control
over, and the productive application of the forces of Nature by society, and
the free development of the social productive powers. It is compatible only
with a system of production, and a society, moving within narrow and more or
less primitive bounds. To perpetuate it would be, as Pecqueur rightly says, â€œto
decree universal mediocrity". At a certain stage of development, it brings
forth the material agencies for its own dissolution. From that moment new
forces and new passions spring up in the bosom of society; but the old social organisation
fetters them and keeps them down. It must be annihilated; it is annihilated.
Its annihilation, the transformation of the individualised and scattered means
of production into socially concentrated ones, of the pigmy property of the
many into the huge property of the few, the expropriation of the great mass of
the people from the soil, from the means of subsistence, and from the means of
labour, this fearful and painful expropriation of the mass of the people forms
the prelude to the history of capital. It comprises a series of forcible
methods, of which we have passed in review only those that have been
epoch-making as methods of the primitive accumulation of capital. The
expropriation of the immediate producers was accomplished with merciless
Vandalism, and under the stimulus of passions the most infamous, the most
sordid, the pettiest, the most meanly odious. Self-earned private property,
that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent
labouring individual with the conditions of his labour, is supplanted by
capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally
free labour of others, <em class="calibre4">i.e</em>., on wage labour.<a href="Capital%20Volume%20I_split_057.htm#_edn1093" title="" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1093"><span class="EndnoteCharacters">1</span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As soon as
this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from
top to bottom, as soon as the labourers are turned into proletarians, their
means of labour into capital, as soon as the capitalist mode of production
stands on its own feet, then the further socialisation of labour and further
transformation of the land and other means of production into socially
exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further
expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now to be
expropriated is no longer the labourer working for himself, but the capitalist
exploiting many labourers. This expropriation is accomplished by the action of
the immanent laws of capitalistic production itself, by the centralisation of
capital. One capitalist always kills many. Hand in hand with this centralisation,
or this expropriation of many capitalists by few, develop, on an ever-extending
scale, the co-operative form of the labour process, the conscious technical
application of science, the methodical cultivation of the soil, the
transformation of the instruments of labour into instruments of labour only
usable in common, the economising of all means of production by their use as
means of production of combined, socialised labour, the entanglement of all
peoples in the net of the world market, and with this, the international
character of the capitalistic regime. Along with the constantly diminishing
number of the magnates of capital, who usurp and monopolise all advantages of
this process of transformation, grows the mass of misery, oppression, slavery,
degradation, exploitation; but with this too grows the revolt of the working
class, a class always increasing in numbers, and disciplined, united, organised
by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself. The
monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production, which has
sprung up and flourished along with, and under it. Centralisation of the means
of production and socialisation of labour at last reach a point where they
become incompatible with their capitalist integument. This integument is burst
asunder. The knell of capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators are
expropriated. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of
production, produces capitalist private property. This is the first negation of
individual private property, as founded on the labour of the proprietor. But
capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its
own negation. It is the negation of negation. This does not re-establish
private property for the producer, but gives him individual property based on
the acquisition of the capitalist era: <em class="calibre4">i.e</em>., on co-operation and the
possession in common of the land and of the means of production. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
transformation of scattered private property, arising from individual labour,
into capitalist private property is, naturally, a process, incomparably more
protracted, violent, and difficult, than the transformation of capitalistic
private property, already practically resting on socialised production, into
socialised property. In the former case, we had the expropriation of the mass
of the people by a few usurpers; in the latter, we have the expropriation of a
few usurpers by the mass of the people.</span></p>
