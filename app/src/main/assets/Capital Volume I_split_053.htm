literary shortcomings in “Das Kapital” more strongly than I myself. Yet I will
for the benefit and the enjoyment of these gentlemen and their public quote in
this connexion one English and one Russian notice. The Saturday Review, always
hostile to my views, said in its notice of the first edition: “The presentation
of the subject invests the driest economic questions with a certain peculiar
charm.” The “St. Petersburg Journal” (Sankt-Peterburgskie Viedomosti), in its
issue of April 8 (20), 1872, says: “The presentation of the subject, with the
exception of one or two exceptionally special parts, is distinguished by its
comprehensibility by the general reader, its clearness, and, in spite of the
scientific intricacy of the subject, by an unusual liveliness. In this respect
the author in no way resembles ... the majority of German scholars who ...
write their books in a language so dry and obscure that the heads of ordinary
mortals are cracked by it.”</span></p>

is that all-sufficient and real measure, by which at all times the value of all
commodities can be estimated and compared, Adam Smith says, “Equal quantities
of labour must at all times and in all places have the same value for the
labourer. In his normal state of health, strength, and activity, and with the
average degree of skill that he may possess, he must always give up the same
portion of his rest, his freedom, and his happiness.” (“Wealth of Nations,” b.
I. ch. V.) On the one hand Adam Smith here (but not everywhere) confuses the
determination of value by means of the quantity of labour expended in the
production of commodities, with the determination of the values of commodities
by means of the value of labour, and seeks in consequence to prove that equal
quantities of labour have always the same value. On the other hand he has a
presentiment, that labour, so far as it manifests itself in the value of
commodities, counts only as expenditure of labour power, but he treats this
expenditure as the mere sacrifice of rest, freedom, and happiness, not as at
the same time the normal activity of living beings. But then, he has the modern
wage-labourer in his eye. Much more aptly, the anonymous predecessor of Adam
Smith, quoted above in note 9, this chapter, says “one man has employed himself
a week in providing this necessary of life ... and he that gives him some other
in exchange cannot make a better estimate of what is a proper equivalent, than
by computing what cost him just as much labour and time; which in effect is no
more than exchanging one man’s labour in one thing for a time certain, for
another man’s labour in another thing for the same time.” (l.c., p. 39.) [The
English language has the advantage of possessing different words for the two
aspects of labour here considered. The labour which creates use value, and
counts qualitatively, is Work, as distinguished from Labour, that which creates
Value and counts quantitatively, is Labour as distinguished from Work - Engels]</span></p>

the practical bourgeois, they exclusively give their attention to the
quantitative aspect of the question. “The command of quantity ... constitutes
value.” (“Money and its Vicissitudes.” London, 1837, p. 11. By S. Bailey.)</span></p>

magnitude of value and its relative expression has, with customary ingenuity,
been exploited by vulgar economists. For example – “Once admit that A falls,
because B, with which it is exchanged, rises, while no less labour is bestowed
in the meantime on A, and your general principle of value falls to the
ground... If he [Ricardo] allowed that when A rises in value relatively to B, B
falls in value relatively to A, he cut away the ground on which he rested his
grand proposition, that the value of a commodity is ever determined by the
labour embodied in it, for if a change in the cost of A alters not only its own
value in relation to B, for which it is exchanged, but also the value of B
relatively to that of A, though no change has taken place in the quantity of
labour to produce B, then not only the doctrine falls to the ground which
asserts that the quantity of labour bestowed on an article regulates its value,
but also that which affirms the cost of an article to regulate its value’ (J.
Broadhurst: “Political Economy,” London, 1842, pp. 11 and 14.) Mr. Broadhurst
might just as well say: consider the fractions 10/20, 10/50, 10/100, &amp;c.,
the number 10 remains unchanged, and yet its proportional magnitude, its
magnitude relatively to the numbers 20, 50, 100 &amp;c., continually
diminishes. Therefore the great principle that the magnitude of a whole number,
such as 10, is “regulated” by the number of times unity is contained in it,
falls to the ground. [The author explains in section 4 of this chapter, pp.

analysis of the magnitude of value, and his analysis is by far the best, will
appear from the 3rd and 4th books of this work. As regards value in general, it
is the weak point of the classical school of Political Economy that it nowhere
expressly and with full consciousness, distinguishes between labour, as it
appears in the value of a product, and the same labour, as it appears in the
use value of that product. Of course the distinction is practically made, since
this school treats labour, at one time under its quantitative aspect, at
another under its qualitative aspect. But it has not the least idea, that when
the difference between various kinds of labour is treated as purely
quantitative, their qualitative unity or equality, and therefore their
reduction to abstract human labour, is implied. For instance, Ricardo declares
that he agrees with Destutt de Tracy in this proposition: “As it is certain
that our physical and moral faculties are alone our original riches, the
employment of those faculties, labour of some kind, is our only original
treasure, and it is always from this employment that all those things are
created which we call riches... It is certain, too, that all those things only
represent the labour which has created them, and if they have a value, or even
two distinct values, they can only derive them from that (the value) of the
labour from which they emanate.” (Ricardo, “The Principles of Pol. Econ.,” 3
Ed. Lond. 1821, p. 334.) We would here only point out, that Ricardo puts his
own more profound interpretation upon the words of Destutt. What the latter
really says is, that on the one hand all things which constitute wealth
represent the labour that creates them, but that on the other hand, they
acquire their “two different values” (use value and exchange value) from “the
value of labour.” He thus falls into the commonplace error of the vulgar
economists, who assume the value of one commodity (in this case labour) in
order to determine the values of the rest. But Ricardo reads him as if he had
said, that labour (not the value of labour) is embodied both in use value and
exchange value. Nevertheless, Ricardo himself pays so little attention to the two-fold
character of the labour which has a two-fold embodiment, that he devotes the
whole of his chapter on “Value and Riches, Their Distinctive Properties,” to a
laborious examination of the trivialities of a J.B. Say. And at the finish he
is quite astonished to find that Destutt on the one hand agrees with him as to
labour being the source of value, and on the other hand with J. B. Say as to
the notion of value.</span></p>

classical economy that it has never succeeded, by means of its analysis of
commodities, and, in particular, of their value, in discovering that form under
which value becomes exchange value. Even Adam Smith and Ricardo, the best
representatives of the school, treat the form of value as a thing of no
importance, as having no connection with the inherent nature of commodities.
The reason for this is not solely because their attention is entirely absorbed
in the analysis of the magnitude of value. It lies deeper. The value form of
the product of labour is not only the most abstract, but is also the most
universal form, taken by the product in bourgeois production, and stamps that
production as a particular species of social production, and thereby gives it
its special historical character. If then we treat this mode of production as
one eternally fixed by Nature for every state of society, we necessarily
overlook that which is the differentia specifica of the value form, and
consequently of the commodity form, and of its further developments, money
form, capital form, &amp;c. We consequently find that economists, who are
thoroughly agreed as to labour time being the measure of the magnitude of
value, have the most strange and contradictory ideas of money, the perfected
form of the general equivalent. This is seen in a striking manner when they
treat of banking, where the commonplace definitions of money will no longer
hold water. This led to the rise of a restored mercantile system (Ganilh,
&amp;c.), which sees in value nothing but a social form, or rather the
unsubstantial ghost of that form. Once for all I may here state, that by
classical Political Economy, I understand that economy which, since the time of
W. Petty, has investigated the real relations of production in bourgeois
society in contradistinction to vulgar economy, which deals with appearances
only, ruminates without ceasing on the materials long since provided by
scientific economy, and there seeks plausible explanations of the most
obtrusive phenomena, for bourgeois daily use, but for the rest, confines itself
to systematising in a pedantic way, and proclaiming for everlasting truths, the
trite ideas held by the self-complacent bourgeoisie with regard to their own
world, to them the best of all possible worlds.</span></p>

who imagines that the ancient Greeks and Romans lived by plunder alone. But
when people plunder for centuries, there must always be something at hand for
them to seize; the objects of plunder must be continually reproduced. It would
thus appear that even Greeks and Romans had some process of production,
consequently, an economy, which just as much constituted the material basis of
their world, as bourgeois economy constitutes that of our modern world. Or
perhaps Bastiat means, that a mode of production based on slavery is based on a
system of plunder. In that case he treads on dangerous ground. If a giant
thinker like Aristotle erred in his appreciation of slave labour, why should a
dwarf economist like Bastiat be right in his appreciation of wage labour? I
seize this opportunity of shortly answering an objection taken by a German
paper in America, to my work, “Zur Kritik der Pol. Oekonomie, 1859.” In the
estimation of that paper, my view that each special mode of production and the
social relations corresponding to it, in short, that the economic structure of
society, is the real basis on which the juridical and political superstructure
is raised and to which definite social forms of thought correspond; that the
mode of production determines the character of the social, political, and
intellectual life generally, all this is very true for our own times, in which
material interests preponderate, but not for the middle ages, in which
Catholicism, nor for Athens and Rome, where politics, reigned supreme. In the
first place it strikes one as an odd thing for any one to suppose that these
well-worn phrases about the middle ages and the ancient world are unknown to
anyone else. This much, however, is clear, that the middle ages could not live
on Catholicism, nor the ancient world on politics. On the contrary, it is the
mode in which they gained a livelihood that explains why here politics, and
there Catholicism, played the chief part. For the rest, it requires but a
slight acquaintance with the history of the Roman republic, for example, to be
aware that its secret history is the history of its landed property. On the
other hand, Don Quixote long ago paid the penalty for wrongly imagining that
knight errantry was compatible with all economic forms of society.</span></p>

real history of the theory; and then he moralises thus: “For the rest, it is
not to be denied that most of the later economists do not bear sufficiently in

then, after all, either more or less than a commodity!)... “So far, the

directly represent labour-time, so that a piece of paper may represent, for instance,
x hours’ labour, is at bottom the same as the question why, given the
production of commodities, must products take the form of commodities? This is
evident, since their taking the form of commodities implies their
differentiation into commodities and money. Or, why cannot private labour —
labour for the account of private individuals — be treated as its opposite,
immediate social labour? I have elsewhere examined thoroughly the Utopian idea
of “labour-money” in a society founded on the production of commodities (l. c.,
p. 61, seq.). On this point I will only say further, that Owen’s
“labour-money,” for instance, is no more “money” than a ticket for the theatre.
Owen pre-supposes directly associated labour, a form of production that is
entirely inconsistent with the production of commodities. The certificate of
labour is merely evidence of the part taken by the individual in the common
labour, and of his right to a certain portion of the common produce destined
for consumption. But it never enters into Owen’s head to pre-suppose the
production of commodities, and at the same time, by juggling with money, to try
to evade the necessary conditions of that production.</span></p>

use the tongue differently. Captain Parry says of the inhabitants on the west

consider the bargain satisfactorily concluded.” In the same way, the Eastern
Esquimaux licked the articles they received in exchange. If the tongue is thus
used in the North as the organ of appropriation, no wonder that, in the South,
the stomach serves as the organ of accumulated property, and that a Kaffir
estimates the wealth of a man by the size of his belly. That the Kaffirs know
what they are about is shown by the following: at the same time that the
official British Health Report of 1864 disclosed the deficiency of fat-forming
food among a large part of the working-class, a certain Dr. Harvey (not,
however, the celebrated discoverer of the circulation of the blood), made a

law been made to perform the function of money or of a measure of value side by
side, it has always been tried, but in vain, to treat them as one and the same
material. To assume that there is an invariable ratio between the quantities of
gold and silver in which a given quantity of labour-time is incorporated, is to
assume in fact, that gold and silver are of one and the same material, and that
a given mass of the less valuable metal, silver, is a constant fraction of a
given mass of gold. From the reign of Edward III. to the time of George II., the
history of money in England consists of one long series of perturbations caused
by the clashing of the legally fixed ratio between the values of gold and
silver, with the fluctuations in their real values. At one time gold was too
high, at another, silver. The metal that for the time being was estimated below
its value, was withdrawn from circulation, mated and exported. The ratio between
the two metals was then again altered by law, but the new nominal ratio soon
came into conflict again with the real one. In our own times, the slight and
transient fall in the value of gold compared with silver, which was a
consequence of the Indo-Chinese demand for silver, produced on a far more
extended scale in France the same phenomena, export of silver, and its
expulsion from circulation by gold. During the years 1855, 1856 and 1857, the
excess in France of gold-imports over gold-exports amounted to £41,580,000,
while the excess of silver-exports over silver-imports was £14,704,000. In
fact, in those countries in which both metals are legally measures of value,
and therefore both legal tender, so that everyone has the option of paying in
either metal, the metal that rises in value is at a premium, and, like every
other commodity, measures its price in the over-estimated metal which alone
serves in reality as the standard of value. The result of all experience and
history with regard to this equation is simply that, where two commodities
perform by law the functions of a measure of value, in practice one alone
maintains that position.” (Karl Marx, l.c., pp. 52, 53.)</span></p>

while the ounce of gold serves in England as the unit of the standard of money,
the pound sterling does not form an aliquot part of it, has been explained as
follows: “Our coinage was originally adapted to the employment of silver only,
hence, an ounce of silver can always be divided into a certain adequate number
of pieces of coin, but as gold was introduced at a later period into a coinage
adapted only to silver, an ounce of gold cannot be coined into an aliquot
number of pieces.” Maclaren, “A Sketch of the History of the Currency.” London,

two methods characteristic of apologetic economy. The first is the
identification of the circulation of commodities with the direct barter of products,
by simple abstraction from their points of difference; the second is, the
attempt to explain away the contradictions of capitalist production, by
reducing the relations between the persons engaged in that mode of production,
to the simple relations arising out of the circulation of commodities. The
production and circulation of commodities are however, phenomena that occur to
a greater or less extent in modes of production the most diverse. If we are
acquainted with nothing but the abstract categories of circulation, which are
common to all these modes of production, we cannot possibly know anything of
the specific points of difference of those modes, nor pronounce any judgment
upon them. In no science is such a big fuss made with commonplace truisms as in
Political Economy. For instance, J. B. Say sets himself up as a judge of
crises, because, forsooth, he knows that a commodity is a product.</span></p>

the common cry; which is a great mistake... What do these people want, who cry

his want, but a price for his corn and cattel, which he would sell, but

he hath, and few of buying; or (2) There wants the usual vent abroad by

it is not the increase of specific money, which would at all advance the

the antagonism, which has its origin in the nature of commodities, and is
reproduced in their circulation, can be removed by increasing the circulating
medium. But if, on the one hand, it is a popular delusion to ascribe stagnation
in production and circulation to insufficiency of the circulating medium, it by

which would prejudice the same. Just as there is a certain proportion of
farthings necessary in a small retail trade, to change silver money, and to
even such reckonings as cannot be adjusted with the smallest silver pieces....
Now, as the proportion of the number of farthings requisite in commerce is to
be taken from the number of people, the frequency of their exchanges: as also,
and principally, from the value of the smallest silver pieces of money; so in
like manner, the proportion of money [gold and silver specie] requisite in our
trade, is to be likewise taken from the frequency of commutations, and from the
bigness of the payments.” (William Petty, “A Treatise of Taxes and
Contributions.” Lond. 1667, p. 17.) The Theory of Hume was defended against the
attacks of J. Steuart and others, by A. Young, in his “Political Arithmetic,”
Lond. 1774, in which work there is a special chapter entitled “Prices depend on
quantity of money, at p. 112, sqq. I have stated in “Zur Kritik, &amp;c.,” p.
149: “He (Adam Smith) passes over without remark the question as to the
quantity of coin in circulation, and treats money quite wrongly as a mere
commodity.” This statement applies only in so far as Adam Smith, ex officio,
treats of money. Now and then, however, as in his criticism of the earlier
systems of Political Economy, he takes the right view. “The quantity of coin in
every country is regulated by the value of the commodities which are to be
circulated by it.... The value of the goods annually bought and sold in any
country requires a certain quantity of money to circulate and distribute them
to their proper consumers, and can give employment to no more. The channel of
circulation necessarily draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it, and never
admits any more.” (“Wealth of Nations.” Bk. IV., ch. 1.) In like manner, ex
officio, he opens his work with an apotheosis on the division of labour.
Afterwards, in the last book which treats of the sources of public revenue, he
occasionally repeats the denunciations of the division of labour made by his
teacher, A. Ferguson.</span></p>

(Jacob Vanderlint: “Money Answers all Things.” Lond. 1734, p. 5.) A careful
comparison of this book with Hume’s “Essays,” proves to my mind without doubt
that Hume was acquainted with and made use of Vanderlint’s work, which is
certainly an important one. The opinion that prices are determined by the
quantity of the circulating medium, was also held by Barbon and other much
earlier writers. “No inconvenience,” says Vanderlint, “can arise by an
unrestrained trade, but very great advantage; since, if the cash of the nation
be decreased by it, which prohibitions are designed to prevent, those nations
that get the cash will certainly find everything advance in price, as the cash
increases amongst them. And ... our manufactures, and everything else, will
soon become so moderate as to turn the balance of trade in our favour, and
thereby fetch the money back again.” (l.c.. pp. 43, 44.)</span></p>

of commodity forms a part of the sum of the prices of all the commodities in
circulation, is a self-evident proposition. But how use-values which are
incommensurable with regard to each other, are to be exchanged, en masse for
the total sum of gold and silver in a country, is quite incomprehensible. If we
start from the notion that all commodities together form one single commodity,
of which each is but an aliquot part, we get the following beautiful result:
The total commodity = x cwt. of gold; commodity A = an aliquot part of the
total commodity = the same aliquot part of x cwt. of gold. This is stated in
all seriousness by Montesquieu: “</span><span lang="FR">Si l’on compare la masse de l’or et de l’argent qui est dans le monde avec
la somme des marchandises qui s’y vend il est certain que chaque denrée ou
marchandise, en particulier, pourra être comparée à une certaine portion de la
masse entière. Supposons qu’il n’y ait qu’une seule denrée ou marchandise dans
le monde, ou qu’il n’y ait qu’une seule qui s’achète, et qu’elle se divise
comme l’argent: Cette partie de cette marchandise répondra à une partie de la
masse de l’argent; la moitié du total de l’une à la moitié du total de l’autre,
&amp;c.... L’établissement du prix des choses dépend toujours fondamentalement
de la raison du total des choses au total des signes</span><span lang="EN-GB">.” [“If one compares the amount of gold and
silver in the world with the sum of the commodities available, it is certain
that each product or commodity, taken in isolation, could be compared with a
certain portion of the total amount of money. Let us suppose that there is only
one product, or commodity, in the world, or only one that can be purchased, and
that it can be divided in the same way as money: a certain part of this
commodity would then correspond to a part of the total amount of money; half
the total of the one would correspond to half the total of the other &amp;c.
... the determination of the prices of things always depends, fundamentally, on
the relation between the total amount of things and the total amount of their
monetary symbols”] (Montesquieu, l.c. t. III, pp. 12, 13.) As to the further
development of this theory by Ricardo and his disciples, James Mill, Lord
Overstone, and others, see “Zur Kritik, &amp;c.,” pp. 140-146, and p. 150, sqq.
John Stuart Mill, with his usual eclectic logic, understands how to hold at the
same time the view of his father, James Mill, and the opposite view. On a
comparison of the text of his compendium, “Principles of Pol. Econ.,” with his
preface to the first edition, in which preface he announces himself as the Adam
Smith of his day — we do not know whether to admire more the simplicity of the
man, or that of the public, who took him, in good faith, for the Adam Smith he
announced himself to be, although he bears about as much resemblance to Adam
Smith as say General Williams, of Kars, to the Duke of Wellington. The original
researches of Mr. J. S. Mill which are neither extensive nor profound, in the
domain of Political Economy, will be found mustered in rank and file in his
little work, “Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy,” which appeared in
1844. Locke asserts point blank the connexion between the absence of value in
gold and silver, and the determination of their values by quantity alone.
“Mankind having consented to put an imaginary value upon gold and silver ...
the intrinsic value, regarded in these metals, is nothing but the
quantity." (“Some Considerations,” <em class="calibre4">&amp;c</em>., 1691, Works Ed. 1777,

Government coins gratuitously, the following opinion of Sir Dudley North:
“Silver and gold, like other commodities, have their ebbings and flowings. Upon
the arrival of quantities from Spain ... it is carried into the Tower, and
coined. Not long after there will come a demand for bullion to be exported
again. If there is none, but all happens to be in coin, what then? Melt it down
again; there’s no loss in it, for the coining costs the owner nothing. Thus the
nation has been abused, and made to pay for the twisting of straw for asses to
eat. If the merchant were made to pay the price of the coinage, he would not
have sent his silver to the Tower without consideration, and coined money would
always keep a value above uncoined silver.” (North, l.c., p. 18.) North was
himself one of the foremost merchants in the reign of Charles II.</span></p>

Fullarton shows the want of clearness on the part of even the best writers on

concerns our domestic exchanges, all the monetary functions which are usually
performed by gold and silver coins, may be performed as effectually by a
circulation of inconvertible notes paying no value but that factitious and
conventional value they derive from the law is a fact which admits, I conceive,
of no denial. Value of this description may be made to answer all the purposes
of intrinsic value, and supersede even the necessity for a standard, provided
only the quantity of issues be kept under due limitation.” (Fullerton:
“Regulation of Currencies,” London, 1845, p. 21.) Because the commodity that
serves as money is capable of being replaced in circulation by mere symbols of
value, therefore its functions as a measure of value and a standard of prices
are declared to be superfluous!</span></p>

called a shilling the name of a greater weight, such as a crown; and so to pay
creditors shillings, instead of crowns. “Money does wear and grow lighter by
often telling over... It is the denomination and currency of the money that men

still continue to perform directly the functions of a hoard. The silver
ornaments are brought out and coined when there is a high rate of interest, and
go back again when the rate of interest falls. (J. S. Mill’s Evidence “Reports

the gold and silver import and export of India, the import of gold and silver

Craig before the Commons’ Committee of 1826, “there was such an immense demand

left in their custody. They sent round to all the different banks to borrow,
but could not get them, and many of the transactions were adjusted by slips of
paper only; yet by three o’clock the whole of the notes were returned into the
banks from which they had issued! It was a mere transfer from hand to hand.
“Although the average effective circulation of bank-notes in Scotland is less
than three millions sterling, yet on certain pay days in the year, every single
note in the possession of the bankers, amounting in the whole to about
£7,000,000, is called into activity. On these occasions the notes have a single

back into the various banks from which they issued. (See John Fullarton,

expense being 40 millions, if the revolutions were in such short circles, viz.,
weekly, as happens among poor artisans and labourers, who receive and pay every
Saturday, then 40/52 parts of 1 million of money would answer these ends, but
if the circles be quarterly, according to our custom of paying rent, and
gathering taxes, then 10 millions were requisite. Wherefore, supposing payments
in general to be of a mixed circle between one week and 13, then add 10
millions to 40/52, the half of which will be 5½, so as if we have 5½ millions

silver, see Karl Marx, l.c., p. 136 sq. Sir Robert Peel, by his Bank Act of
1844, sought to tide over the difficulty, by allowing the Bank of England to
issue notes against silver bullion, on condition that the reserve of silver
should never exceed more than one-fourth of the reserve of gold. The value of

<p class="MsoNormal"><em class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">Added
in the 4th German edition. —</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> [We find ourselves once more in a period of serious change in the
relative values of gold and silver. About 25 years ago the ratio expressing the
relative value of gold and silver was 15-1/2:1; now it is approximately 22:1,
and silver is still constantly falling as against gold. This is essentially the
result of a revolution in the mode of production of both metals. Formerly gold
was obtained almost exclusively by washing it out from gold-bearing alluvial
deposits, products of the weathering of auriferous rocks. Now this method has
become inadequate and has been forced into the background by the processing of
the quartz lodes themselves, a way of extraction which formerly was only of
secondary importance, although well known to the ancients (Diodorus, III,
12-14) (Diodor’s v. Sicilien “Historische Bibliothek,” book III, 12-14.
Stuttgart 1828, pp. 258-261). Moreover, not only were new huge silver deposits
discovered in North America, in the Western part of the Rocky Mountains, but
these and the Mexican silver mines were really opened up by the laying of
railways, which made possible the shipment of modern machinery and fuel and in
consequence the mining of silver on a very large scale at a low cost. However
there is a great difference in the way the two metals occur in the quartz
lodes. The gold is mostly native, but disseminated throughout the quartz in
minute quantities. The whole mass of the vein must therefore be crushed and the
gold either washed out or extracted by means of mercury. Often 1,000,000
grammes of quartz barely yield 1-3 and very seldom 30-60 grammes of gold.
Silver is seldom found native, however it occurs in special quartz that is
separated from the lode with comparative ease and contains mostly 40-90%
silver; or it is contained, in smaller quantities, in copper, lead and other ores
which in themselves are worthwhile working. From this alone it is apparent that
the labour expended on the production of gold is rather increasing while that
expended on silver production has decidedly decreased, which quite naturally
explains the drop in the value of the latter. This fall in value would express
itself in a still greater fall in price if the price of silver were not pegged
even to-day by artificial means. But America’s rich silver deposits have so far
barely been tapped, and thus the prospects are that the value of this metal
will keep on dropping for rather a long time to come. A still greater
contributing factor here is the relative decrease in the requirement of silver
for articles of general use and for luxuries, that is its replacement by plated
goods, aluminium, etc. One may thus gauge the utopianism of the bimetallist
idea that compulsory international quotation will raise silver again to the old
value ratio of 1:15-1/2. It is more likely that silver will forfeit its money
function more and more in the markets of the world. — <em class="calibre4">F E.</em>]</span></p>

mercantile system, a system which considered the settlement of surplus trade
balances in gold and silver as the aim of international trade, entirely
misconceived the functions of money of the world. I have shown by the example
of Ricardo in what way their false conception of the laws that regulate the
quantity of the circulating medium, is reflected in their equally false
conception of the international movement of the precious metals (l.c., pp. 150
sq.). His erroneous dogma: “An unfavourable balance of trade never arises but
from a redundant currency.... The exportation of the coin is caused by its
cheapness, and is not the effect, but the cause of an unfavourable balance,”
already occurs in Barbon: “The Balance of Trade, if there be one, is not the
cause of sending away the money out of a nation; but that proceeds from the
difference of the value of bullion in every country.” (N. Barbon; l.c., pp. 59,
60.) MacCulloch in “The Literature of Political Economy, a classified
catalogue, Lond. 1845,” praises Barbon for this anticipation, but prudently
passes over the naive forms, in which Barbon clothes the absurd supposition on
which the “currency principle” is based. The absence of real criticism and even
of honesty, in that catalogue culminates in the sections devoted to the history
of the theory of money; the reason is that MacCulloch in this part of the work
is flattering Lord Overstone whom he calls “facile princeps argentanorum.”</span></p>

money,”] says Mercier de la Rivière to the Mercantilists (l.c., p. 486.) In a
work, which, ex professo treats of “trade” and “speculation,” occurs the
following: “All trade consists in the exchange of things of different kinds;
and the advantage” (to the merchant?) “arises out of this difference. To
exchange a pound of bread against a pound of bread ... would be attended with
no advantage; ... Hence trade is advantageously contrasted with gambling, which
consists in a mere exchange of money for money.” (Th. Corbet, “An Inquiry into
the Causes and Modes of the Wealth of Individuals; or the Principles of Trade
and Speculation Explained.” London, 1841, p. 5.) Although Corbet does not see
that M-M, the exchange of money for money, is the characteristic form of
circulation, not only of merchants’ capital but of all capital, yet at least he
acknowledges that this form is common to gambling and to one species of trade, viz.,
speculation: but then comes MacCulloch and makes out, that to buy in order to
sell, is to speculate, and thus the difference between Speculation and Trade
vanishes. “Every transaction in which an individual buys produce in order to
sell it again, is, in fact, a speculation.” (MacCulloch: “A Dictionary
Practical, &amp;c., of Commerce.” Lond., 1847, p. 1009.) With much more
naiveté, Pinto, the Pindar of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, remarks, “Le
commerce est un jeu: (taken from Locke) et ce n’est pas avec des gueux qu’on
peut gagner. Si l’on gagnait longtemps en tout avec tous, il faudrait rendre de
bon accord les plus grandes parties du profit pour recommencer le jeu.” [“Trade
is a game, and nothing can be won from beggars. If one won everything from everybody
all the time, it would be necessary to give back the greater part of the profit
voluntarily, in order to begin the game again”] (Pinto: “Traité de la

to Chrematistic. He starts from the former. So far as it is the art of gaining
a livelihood, it is limited to procuring those articles that are necessary to existence,
and useful either to a household or the state. “True wealth (o aleqinos
ploutos) consists of such values in use; for the quantity of possessions of
this kind, capable of making life pleasant, is not unlimited. There is,
however, a second mode of acquiring things, to which we may by preference and
with correctness give the name of Chrematistic, and in this case there appear
to be no limits to riches and possessions. Trade (e kapelike is literally
retail trade, and Aristotle takes this kind because in it values in use
predominate) does not in its nature belong to Chrematistic, for here the
exchange has reference only to what is necessary to themselves (the buyer or
seller).” Therefore, as he goes on to show, the original form of trade was
barter, but with the extension of the latter, there arose the necessity for
money. On the discovery of money, barter of necessity developed into kapelike,
into trading in commodities, and this again, in opposition to its original
tendency, grew into Chrematistic, into the art of making money. Now
Chrematistic is distinguishable from Oeconomic in this way, that “in the case
of Chrematistic circulation is the source of riches poietike crematon ... dia
chrematon diaboles. And it appears to revolve about money, for money is the
beginning and end of this kind of exchange (to nomisma stoiceion tes allages
estin). Therefore also riches, such as Chrematistic strives for, are unlimited.
Just as every art that is not a means to an end, but an end in itself, has no
limit to its aims, because it seeks constantly to approach nearer and nearer to
that end, while those arts that pursue means to an end, are not boundless,
since the goal itself imposes a limit upon them, so with Chrematistic, there
are no bounds to its aims, these aims being absolute wealth. Oeconomic not
Chrematistic has a limit ... the object of the former is something different
from money, of the latter the augmentation of money.... By confounding these
two forms, which overlap each other, some people have been led to look upon the
preservation and increase of money ad infinitum as the end and aim of
Oeconomic.” (Aristoteles, <i class="calibre4">De Rep.</i> edit. Bekker, lib. l.c. 8, 9. passim.)</span></p>
