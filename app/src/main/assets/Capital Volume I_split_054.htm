turned to account the writings of the Physiocrats, in his day quite forgotten,
for the purpose of expanding the “value” of his own. His most celebrated
saying, “On n’achète des produits qu’avec des produits” [“Products can only be

the reader will see that this statement only means that the formation of
capital must be possible even though the price and value of a commodity be the
same; for its formation cannot be attributed to any deviation of the one from
the other. If prices actually differ from values, we must, first of all, reduce
the former to the latter, in other words, treat the difference as accidental in
order that the phenomena may be observed in their purity, and our observations
not interfered with by disturbing circumstances that have nothing to do with
the process in question. We know, moreover, that this reduction is no mere
scientific process. The continual oscillations in prices, their rising and
falling, compensate each other, and reduce themselves to an average price,
which is their hidden regulator. It forms the guiding star of the merchant or
the manufacturer in every undertaking that requires time. He knows that when a
long period of time is taken, commodities are sold neither over nor under, but
at their average price. If therefore he thought about the matter at all, he
would formulate the problem of the formation of capital as follows: How can we
account for the origin of capital on the supposition that prices are regulated
by the average price, i. e., ultimately by the value of the commodities? I say
“ultimately,” because average prices do not directly coincide with the values
of commodities, as Adam Smith, Ricardo, and others believe.</span></p>

Latin, usually translated: “Rhodes is here, here is where you jump!”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" class="calibre12">Originates from the traditional Latin translation of the punch line from
Aesop’s fable </span>The Boastful Athlete<span lang="EN" class="calibre12"> which has been the subject of some mistranslations. In
Greek, the maxim reads:</span></p>

<p class="indentb"><span lang="EN" class="calibre12"><span> </span>“ιδού η
ρόδος,<br class="calibre7"/>
ιδού και το
πήδημα”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The story is
that an athlete boasts that when in Rhodes, he performed a stupendous jump, and
that there were witnesses who could back up his story. A bystander then
remarked, ‘Alright! Let’s say this is Rhodes, demonstrate the jump here and
now.’ The fable shows that people must be known by their deeds, not by their
own claims for themselves. In the context in which Hegel used it in the <i class="calibre4">Philosophy
of Right</i>, this could be taken to mean that the philosophy of right must
have to do with the <i class="calibre4">actuality </i>of modern society, not the theories and
ideals that societies create for themselves, nor, as Hegel goes on to say, to “</span>teach
the world what it ought to be<span lang="EN">.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The epigram
is given by Hegel first in Greek, then in Latin (in the form “<i class="calibre4">Hic</i>
Rhodus, <i class="calibre4">hic</i> saltus”), and he then says: “With little change, the above
saying would read (in German): “<i class="calibre4">Hier</i> ist die Rose, <i class="calibre4">hier</i> tanze”:
“Here is the rose, dance here”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">This is taken
to be an allusion to the ‘rose in the cross’ of the Rosicrucians (who claimed
to possess esoteric knowledge with which they could transform social life),
implying that the material for understanding and changing society is given in
society itself, not in some other-worldly theory, punning first on the Greek (<i class="calibre4">Rhodos</i>
= Rhodes, <i class="calibre4">rhodon</i> = rose), then on the Latin (<i class="calibre4">saltus</i> = jump

countries fixes a maximum for labour-contracts. Wherever free labour is the
rule, the laws regulate the mode of terminating this contract. In some States,
particularly in Mexico (before the American Civil War, also in the territories
taken from Mexico, and also, as a matter of fact, in the Danubian provinces
till the revolution effected by Kusa), slavery is hidden under the form of <em class="calibre4">peonage</em>.
By means of advances, repayable in labour, which are handed down from
generation to generation, not only the individual labourer, but his family,
become, <em class="calibre4">de facto</em>, the property of other persons and their families.
Juarez abolished <em class="calibre4">peonage</em>. The so-called Emperor Maximilian re-established
it by a decree, which, in the House of Representatives at Washington, was aptly
denounced as a decree for the re-introduction of slavery into Mexico. “I may
make over to another the use, for a limited time, of my particular bodily and
mental aptitudes and capabilities; because in consequence of this restriction,
they are impressed with a character of alienation with regard to me as a whole.
But by the alienation of all my labour-time and the whole of my work, I should
be converting the substance itself, in other words, my general activity and
reality, my person, into the property of another.” (Hegel, “Philosophie des
Rechts.” Berlin, 1840, p. 104, § 67.)</span></p>

characterised by this, that labour-power takes in the eyes of the labourer
himself the form of a commodity which is his property; his labour consequently

two sorts of bakers, the “full priced,” who sell bread at its full value, and
the “undersellers,” who sell it under its value. The latter class comprises
more than three-fourths of the total number of bakers. (p. xxxii in the Report
of H. S. Tremenheere, commissioner to examine into “the grievances complained
of by the journeymen bakers,” &amp;c., Lond. 1862.) The undersellers, almost
without exception, sell bread adulterated with alum, soap, pearl ashes, chalk,
Derbyshire stone-dust, and such like agreeable nourishing and wholesome
ingredients. (See the above cited Blue book, as also the report of “the
committee of 1855 on the adulteration of bread,” and Dr. Hassall’s
“Adulterations Detected,” 2nd Ed. Lond. 1861.) Sir John Gordon stated before
the committee of 1855, that “in consequence of these adulterations, the poor
man, who lives on two pounds of bread a day, does not now get one fourth part
of nourishing matter, let alone the deleterious effects on his health.”
Tremenheere states (l.c., p. xlviii), as the reason, why a very large part of
the working-class, although well aware of this adulteration, nevertheless
accept the alum, stone-dust, &amp;c., as part of their purchase: that it is for
them “a matter of necessity to take from their baker or from the chandler’s
shop, such bread as they choose to supply.” As they are not paid their wages
before the end of the week, they in their turn are unable “to pay for the bread
consumed by their families, during the week, before the end of the week,” and
Tremenheere adds on the evidence of witnesses, “it is notorious that bread
composed of those mixtures, is made expressly for sale in this manner.” In many
English and still more Scotch agricultural districts, wages are paid
fortnightly and even monthly; with such long intervals between the payments,
the agricultural labourer is obliged to buy on credit.... He must pay higher
prices, and is in fact tied to the shop which gives him credit. Thus at
Horningham in Wilts, for example, where the wages are monthly, the same flour
that he could buy elsewhere at 1s 10d per stone, costs him 2s 4d per stone.
(“Sixth Report” on “Public Health” by “The Medical Officer of the Privy
Council, &amp;c., 1864,” p.264.) “The block printers of Paisley and Kilmarnock
enforced, by a strike, fortnightly, instead of monthly payment of wages.”
(“Reports of the Inspectors of Factories for 31st Oct., 1853,” p. 34.) As a
further pretty result of the credit given by the workmen to the capitalist, we
may refer to the method current in many English coal mines, where the labourer
is not paid till the end of the month, and in the meantime, receives sums on
account from the capitalist, often in goods for which the miner is obliged to
pay more than the market price (Truck-system). “It is a common practice with
the coal masters to pay once a month, and advance cash to their workmen at the
end of each intermediate week. The cash is given in the shop” (i.e., the Tommy
shop which belongs to the master); “the men take it on one side and lay it out
on the other.” (“Children’s Employment Commission, III. Report,” Lond. 1864, p.
38, n. 192.)</span></p>

appropriation of the products remains the same as before; it is in no way altered

flax), “of as it were heaping up various values in layers on top of one single
value, has the result that this value grows to the same extent ... The
expression ‘addition’ gives a very clear picture of the way in which the price
of a manufactured product is formed; this price is only the sum of a number of
values which have been consumed, and it is arrived at by adding them together;

and implement feel that he is none of them, but is a man. He convinces himself
with immense satisfaction, that he is a different being, by treating the one
unmercifully and damaging the other con amore. Hence the principle, universally
applied in this method of production, only to employ the rudest and heaviest
implements and such as are difficult to damage owing to their sheer clumsiness.
In the slave-states bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, down to the date of the

J. E. Cairnes. “The Slave Power,” London, 1862, p. 46 sqq. In his “Sea Board
Slave States,” Olmsted tells us: “I am here shown tools that no man in his
senses, with us, would allow a labourcr, for whom he was paying wages, to be
encumbered with; and the excessive weight and clumsiness of which, I would
judge, would make work at least ten per cent greater than with those ordinarily
used with us. And I am assured that, in the careless and clumsy way they must
be used by the slaves, anything lighter or less rude could not be furnished
them with good economy, and that such tools as we constantly give our labourers
and find our profit in giving them, would not last out a day in a Virginia
cornfield – much lighter and more free from stones though it be than ours. So, too,
when I ask why mules are so universally substituted for horses on the farm, the
first reason given, and confessedly the most conclusive one, is that horses
cannot bear the treatment that they always must get from negroes; horses are
always soon foundered or crippled by them, while mules will bear cudgelling, or
lose a meal or two now and then, and not be materially injured, and they do not
take cold or get sick, if neglected or overworked. But I do not need to go
further than to the window of the room in which I am writing, to see at almost
any time, treatment of cattle that would ensure the immediate discharge of the
driver by almost any farmer owning them in the North.”</span></p>

unskilled labour rests in part on pure illusion, or, to say the least, on
distinctions that have long since ceased to be real, and that survive only by
virtue of a traditional convention; in part on the helpless condition of some
groups of the working-class, a condition that prevents them from exacting
equally with the rest the value of their labour-power. Accidental circumstances
here play so great a part, that these two forms of labour sometimes change
places. Where, for instance, the physique of the working-class has
deteriorated, and is, relatively speaking, exhausted, which is the case in all
countries with a well developed capitalist production, the lower forms of
labour, which demand great expenditure of muscle, are in general considered as
skilled, compared with much more delicate forms of labour; the latter sink down
to the level of unskilled labour. Take as an example the labour of a
bricklayer, which in England occupies a much higher level than that of a
damask-weaver. Again, although the labour of a fustian cutter demands great
bodily exertion, and is at the same time unhealthy, yet it counts only as
unskilled labour. And then, we must not forget, that the so-called skilled
labour does not occupy a large space in the field of national labour. Laing
estimates that in England (and Wales) the livelihood of 11,300,000 people
depends on unskilled labour. If from the total population of 18,000,000 living
at the time when he wrote, we deduct 1,000,000 for the “genteel population,”
and 1,500,000 for paupers, vagrants, criminals, prostitutes, &amp;c., and
4,650,000 who compose the middle-class, there remain the above mentioned
11,000,000. But in his middle-class he includes people that live on the
interest of small investments, officials, men of letters, artists,
schoolmasters and the like, and in order to swell the number he also includes
in these 4,650,000 the better paid portion of the factory operatives! The
bricklayers, too, figure amongst them. (S. Laing: “National Distress,” &amp;c.,
London, 1844). “The great class who have nothing to give for food but ordinary

implements of labour does not concern us here. A machine that is undergoing
repair, no longer plays the part of an instrument, but that of a subject of
labour. Work is no longer done with it, but upon it. It is quite permissible
for our purpose to assume, that the labour expended on the repairs of
instruments is included in the labour necessary for their original production.
But in the text we deal with that wear and tear, which no doctor can cure, and
which little by little brings about death, with “that kind of wear which cannot
be repaired from time to time, and which, in the case of a knife, would
ultimately reduce it to a state in which the cutler would say of it, it is not
worth a new blade.” We have shewn in the text, that a machine takes part in
every labour-process as an integral machine, but that into the simultaneous
process of creating value it enters only bit by bit. How great then is the
confusion of ideas exhibited in the following extract! “Mr. Ricardo says a
portion of the labour of the engineer in making [stocking] machines” is
contained for example in the value of a pair of stockings. “Yet the total
labour, that produced each single pair of stockings ... includes the whole
labour of the engineer, not a portion; for one machine makes many pairs, and
none of those pairs could have been done without any part of the machine.”
“Obs. on Certain Verbal Disputes in Pol. Econ., Particularly Relating to
Value,” p. 54. The author, an uncommonly self-satisfied wiseacre, is right in
his confusion and therefore in his contention, to this extent only, that
neither Ricardo nor any other economist, before or since him, has accurately
distinguished the two aspects of labour, and still less, therefore, the part
played by it under each of these aspects in the formation of value.</span></p>

absurdity of J. B. Say, who pretends to account for surplus-value (Interest,
Profit, Rent), by the “services productifs” which the means of production,
soil, instruments, and raw material, render in the labour-process by means of
their use-values. Mr. Wm. Roscher who seldom loses an occasion of registering,
in black and white, ingenious apologetic fancies, records the following
specimen: - “J. B. Say (Traité, t. 1, ch. 4) very truly remarks: the value
produced by an oil mill, after deduction of all costs, is something new,
something quite different from the labour by which the oil mill itself was
erected.” (l.c., p. 82, note.) Very true, Mr. Professor! the oil produced by
the oil mill is indeed something very different from the labour expended in
constructing the mill! By value, Mr. Roscher understands such stuff as “oil,”
because oil has value, notwithstanding that “Nature” produces petroleum, though
relatively “in small quantities,” a fact to which he seems to refer in his
further observation: “It (Nature) produces scarcely any exchange-value.” Mr.
Roscher’s “Nature” and the exchange-value it produces are rather like the
foolish virgin who admitted indeed that she had had a child, but “it was such a
little one.” This “savant sérieux” in continuation remarks: “Ricardo’s school
is in the habit of including capital as accumulated labour under the head of
labour. This is unskilful work, because, indeed, the owner of capital, after
all, does something more than the merely creating and preserving of the same:
namely, the abstention from the enjoyment of it, for which he demands, <em class="calibre4">e.g.</em>,
interest.” (l.c.) How very “skilful” is this “anatomico-physiological method”
of Political Economy, which, “indeed,” converts a mere desire “after all” into
a source of value.</span></p>

He estimates them at £6,000 a year. Among them are a number of items that do
not concern us here, such as rent, rates, and taxes, insurance, salaries of the
manager, book-keeper, engineer, and others. Then he reckons £150 for coal used
to heat the mill occasionally, and run the engine now and then. Besides this,
he includes the wages of the people employed at odd times to keep the machinery
in working order. Lastly, he puts down £1,200 for depreciation of machinery,
because “the weather and the natural principle of decay do not suspend their
operations because the steam-engine ceases to revolve.” He says, emphatically,
he does not estimate his depreciation at more than the small sum of £1,200,

gone through, perhaps, 20 editions, this passage occurs: “It matters not in

possible ingredients of production whose value re-appears in the product, the
passage concludes thus: “The various kinds of food, clothing, and shelter,
necessary for the existence and comfort of the human being, are also changed.
They are consumed from time to time, and their value re-appears in that new
vigour imparted to his body and mind, forming fresh capital, to be employed
again in the work of production.” (F. Wayland, l.c., pp. 31, 32.) Without
noticing any other oddities, it suffices to observe, that what re-appears in
the fresh vigour, is not the bread’s price, but its bloodforming substances.
What, on the other hand, re-appears in the value of that vigour, is not the
means of subsistence, but their value. The same necessaries of life, at half
the price, would form just as much muscle and bone, just as much vigour, but
not vigour of the same value. This confusion of “value” and “vigour” coupled
with our author’s pharisaical indefiniteness, mark an attempt, futile for all
that, to thrash out an explanation of surplus-value from a mere re-appearance
of pre-existing values.</span></p>

compel the weak to economise. (l.c., p. 78.) To economise what? Labour? Or superfluous
wealth that does not exist? What is it that makes such men as Roscher account
for the origin of surplus-value, by a mere rechauffé of the more of less

pass such extraordinary notions as are of no importance for our purpose; for
instance, the assertion, that manufacturers reckon as part of their profit,
gross or net, the amount required to make good wear and tear of machinery, or
in other words, to replace a part of the capital. So, too, we pass over any
question as to the accuracy of his figures. Leonard Horner has shown in “A
Letter to Mr. Senior,” &amp;c., London, 1837, that they are worth no more than
so-called “Analysis.” Leonard Horner was one of the Factory Inquiry
Commissioners in 1833, and Inspector, or rather Censor of Factories till 1859.
He rendered undying service to the English working-class. He carried on a
life-long contest, not only with the embittered manufacturers, but also with
the Cabinet, to whom the number of votes given by the masters in the Lower
House, was a matter of far greater importance than the number of hours worked
by the “hands” in the mills.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Apart
from efforts in principle, Senior’s statement is confused. What he really
intended to say was this: The manufacturer employs the workman for 11½ hours or
for 23 half-hours daily. As the working day, so, too, the working year, may be
conceived to consist of 11½ hours or 23 half-hours, but each multiplied by the
number of working days in the year. On this supposition, the 23 half-hours
yield an annual product of £115,000; one half-hour yields 1/23 × £115,000; 20
half-hours yield 20/23 × £115,000 = £100,000, i.e., they replace no more than
the capital advanced. There remain 3 half-hours, which yield 1/23 × £115,000 =
£5,000 or the gross profit. Of these 3 half-hours, one yields 1/23 × £115,000 =
£5,000; i.e., it makes up for the wear and tear of the machinery; the remaining
2 half-hours, i.e., the last hour, yield 2/23 × £115,000 = £10,000 or the net
profit. In the text Senior converts the last 2/23 of the product into portions
of the working day itself.</span></p>

that the net profit of the manufacturer, the existence of he English cotton
industry, and England’s command of the markets of the world, depend on “the
last working-hour,” on the other hand, Dr. Andrew Ure showed, that if children
and young persons under 18 years of age, instead of being kept the full 12
hours in the warm and pure moral atmosphere of the factory, are turned out an
hour sooner into the heartless and frivolous outer world, they will be
deprived, by idleness and vice, of all hope of salvation for their souls. Since
1848, the factory inspectors have never tired of twitting the masters with this
“last,” this “fatal hour.” Thus Mr. Hovell in his report of the 21st May, 1855:
“Had the following ingenious calculation (he quotes Senior) been correct, every
cotton factory in the United Kingdom would have been working at a loss since
the year 1850.” (Reports of the Insp. of Fact., for the half-year, ending 30th
April, 1855, pp. 19, 20.) In the year 1848, after the passing of the 10 hours’
bill, the masters of some flax spinning mills, scattered, few and far between,
over the country on the borders of Dorset and Somerset, foisted a petition
against the bill on to the shoulders of a few of their work-people. One of the
clauses of this petition is as follows: “Your petitioners, as parents, conceive
that an additional hour of leisure will tend more to demoralise the children
than otherwise, believing that idleness is the parent of vice.” On this the
factory report of 31st Oct., 1848, says: The atmosphere of the flax mills, in
which the children of these virtuous and tender parents work, is so loaded with
dust and fibre from the raw material, that it is exceptionally unpleasant to
stand even 10 minutes in the spinning rooms: for you are unable to do so
without the most painful sensation, owing to the eyes, the ears, the nostrils,
and mouth, being immediately filled by the clouds of flax dust from which there
is no escape. The labour itself, owing to the feverish haste of the machinery,
demands unceasing application of skill and movement, under the control of a
watchfulness that never tires, and it seems somewhat hard, to let parents apply
the term “idling” to their own children, who, after allowing for meal-times,
are fettered for 10 whole hours to such an occupation, in such an
atmosphere.... These children work longer than the labourers in the
neighbouring villages.... Such cruel talk about “idleness and vice” ought to be
branded as the purest cant, and the most shameless hypocrisy.... That portion
of the public, who, about 12 years ago, were struck by the assurance with
which, under the sanction of high authority, it was publicly and most earnestly
proclaimed, that the whole net profit of the manufacturer flows from the labour
of the last hour, and that, therefore, the reduction of the working day by one
hour, would destroy his net profit, that portion of the public, we say, will
hardly believe its own eyes, when it now finds, that the original discovery of
the virtues of “the last hour” has since been so far improved, as to include
morals as well as profit; so that, if the duration of the labour of children,
is reduced to a full 10 hours, their morals, together with the net profits of
their employers, will vanish, both being dependent on this last, this fatal
hour. (See Repts., Insp. of Fact., for 31st Oct., 1848, p. 101.) The same
report then gives some examples of the morality and virtue of these same
pure-minded manufacturers, of the tricks, the artifices, the cajoling, the
threats, and the falsifications, they made use of, in order, first, to compel a
few defenceless workmen to sign petitions of such a kind, and then to impose
them upon Parliament as the petitions of a whole branch of industry, or a whole
country. It is highly characteristic of the present status of so-called
economic science, that neither Senior himself, who, at a later period, to his
honour be it said, energetically supported the factory legislation, nor his
opponents, from first to last, have ever been able to explain the false
conclusions of the “original discovery.” They appeal to actual experience, but
the why and wherefore remains a mystery.</span></p>

was not without some benefit from his journey to Manchester. In the “Letters on

written for the instruction of Oxford students and cultivated Philistines, he
had also “discovered, in opposition to Ricardo’s determination of value by
labour, that profit is derived from the labour of the capitalist, and interest
from his asceticism, in other words, from his abstinence.” The dodge was an old
one, but the word “abstinence” was new. Herr Roscher translates it rightly by
“Enthaltung.” Some of his countrymen, the Browns, Jones, and Robinsons, of

colonists in Brandenburg, Pomerania, Silesia, and Eastern Prussia, were even
legally acknowledged as free men. The victory of the nobility in the peasants’
war put an end to that. Not only were the conquered South German peasants again
enslaved. From the middle of the 16th century the peasants of Eastern Prussia,

height of adult men, and generally their fitness for military service, has
diminished. Before the revolution (1789), the minimum for the infantry in
France was 165 centimetres; in 1818 (law of March 10th), 157; by the law of
March 21, 1832, 156 cm.; on the average in France more than half are rejected

Saxony was in 1780, 178 cm. It is now 155. In Prussia it is 157. According to
the statement of Dr. Meyer in the Bavarian Gazette, May 9th, 1862, the result

period I refer the reader to “Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England,” <span>[Condition of the Working Class in England]</span> von Friedrich
Engels, Leipzig, 1845. How completely Engels understood the nature of the
capitalist mode of production is shown by the Factory Reports, Reports on
Mines, &amp;c., that have appeared since 1845, and how wonderfully he painted
the circumstances in detail is seen on the most superficial comparison of his
work with the official reports of the Children’s Employment Commission,
published 18 to 20 years later (1863-1867). These deal especially with the
branches of industry in which the Factory Acts had not, up to 1862, been
introduced, in fact are not yet introduced. Here, then, little or no alteration
had been enforced, by authority, in the conditions painted by Engels. I borrow
my examples chiefly from the Free-trade period after 1848, that age of
paradise, of which the commercial travellers for the great firm of Free-trade,
blatant as ignorant, tell such fabulous tales. For the rest England figures
here in the foreground because she is the classic representative of capitalist
production, and she alone has a continuous set of official statistics of the
things we are considering.</span></p>

With what fanaticism, according to the evidence of manufacturers given in
courts of law, their hands set themselves against every interruption in factory
labour, the following curious circumstance shows. In the beginning of June,
1836, information reached the magistrates of Dewsbury (Yorkshire) that the
owners of 8 large mills in the neighbourhood of Batley had violated the Factory
Acts. Some of these gentlemen were accused of having kept at work 5 boys
between 12 and 15 years of age, from 6 a.m. on Friday to 4 p.m. on the
following Saturday, not allowing them any respite except for meals and one hour
for sleep at midnight. And these children had to do this ceaseless labour of 30
hours in the “shoddyhole,” as the hole is called, in which the woollen rags are
pulled in pieces, and where a dense atmosphere of dust, shreds, &amp;c., forces
even the adult workman to cover his mouth continually with handkerchiefs for
the protection of his lungs! The accused gentlemen affirm in lieu of taking an
oath — as quakers they were too scrupulously religious to take an oath — that
they had, in their great compassion for the unhappy children, allowed them four
hours for sleep, but the obstinate children absolutely would not go to bed. The
quaker gentlemen were mulcted in £20. Dryden anticipated these gentry: </span></p>

Trades’ Union among the agricultural labourers at first in Scotland is a
historic event. In one of the most oppressed agricultural districts of England,
Buckinghamshire, the labourers, in March, 1867, made a great strike for the
raising of their weekly wage from 9-10 shillings to 12 shillings. (It will be
seen from the preceding passage that the movement of the English agricultural
proletariat, entirely crushed since the suppression of its violent
manifestations after 1830, and especially since the introduction of the new
Poor Laws, begins again in the sixties, until it becomes finally epoch-making
in 1872. I return to this in the 2nd volume, as well as to the Blue books that

headings, “Fearful and fatal accidents,” “Appalling tragedies,” &amp;c., a
whole list of fresh railway catastrophes. On these an employee on the North
Staffordshire line comments: “Everyone knows the consequences that may occur if
the driver and fireman of a locomotive engine are not continually on the
look-out. How can that be expected from a man who has been at such work for 29
or 30 hours, exposed to the weather, and without rest. The following is an
example which is of very frequent occurrence: — One fireman commenced work on
the Monday morning at a very early hour. When he had finished what is called a
day’s work, he had been on duty 14 hours 50 minutes. Before he had time to get
his tea, he was again called on for duty.... The next time he finished he had
been on duty 14 hours 25 minutes, making a total of 29 hours 15 minutes without
intermission. The rest of the week’s work was made up as follows: — Wednesday,
15 hours; Thursday, 15 hours 35 minutes; Friday, 14½ hours; Saturday, 14 hours
10 minutes, making a total for the week of 88 hours 30 minutes. Now, sir, fancy
his astonishment on being paid 6 1/4 days for the whole. Thinking it was a
mistake, he applied to the time-keeper,... and inquired what they considered a
day’s work, and was told 13 hours for a goods man (<em class="calibre4">i.e</em>., 78 hours)....
He then asked for what he had made over and above the 78 hours per week, but
was refused. However, he was at last told they would give him another quarter, <em class="calibre4">i.e</em>.,

be in a sleeping room 300, and in a dwelling room 500 cubic feet.” Dr.
Richardson, Senior Physician to one of the London Hospitals: “With needlewomen
of all kinds, including milliners, dressmakers, and ordinary seamstresses,
there are three miseries — over-work, deficient air, and either deficient food
or deficient digestion.... Needlework, in the main, ... is infinitely better
adapted to women than to men. But the mischiefs of the trade, in the metropolis
especially, are that it is monopolised by some twenty-six capitalists, who,
under the advantages that spring from capital, can bring in capital to force
economy out of labour. This power tells throughout the whole class. If a
dressmaker can get a little circle of customers, such is the competition that,
in her home, she must work to the death to hold together, and this same
over-work she must of necessity inflict on any who may assist her. If she fail,
or do not try independently, she must join an establishment, where her labour
is not less, but where her money is safe. Placed thus, she becomes a mere
slave, tossed about with the variations of society. Now at home, in one room,
starving, or near to it, then engaged 15, 16, aye, even 18 hours out of the 24,
in an air that is scarcely tolerable, and on food which, even if it be good,
cannot be digested in the absence of pure air. On these victims, consumption,
which is purely a disease of bad air, feeds.” Dr. Richardson: “Work and

slave-owners against Bright, &amp;c. “Very many of us think,” says a leader of
July 2nd, 1863, “that, while we work our own young women to death, using the
scourge of starvation, instead of the crack of the whip, as the instrument of
compulsion, we have scarcely a right to hound on fire and slaughter against
families who were born slave-owners, and who, at least, feed their slaves well,

conductors of London, &amp;c., work 16 hours a-day for the wages of a dog.”
Finally, spake the oracle, Thomas Carlyle, of whom I wrote, in 1850, “Zum

parable, he reduces the one great event of contemporary history, the American
Civil War, to this level, that the Peter of the North wants to break the head

hires his labour by the day, and the Paul of the South hires his by the life. (<em class="calibre4">Macmillan’s

children in night-labour remarked: “It seems but natural that boys who work at
night cannot sleep and get proper rest by day, but will be running about.”
(l.c., Fourth Report, 63, p. xiii.) On the importance of sunlight for the
maintenance and growth of the body, a physician writes: “Light also acts upon
the tissues of the body directly in hardening them and supporting their
elasticity. The muscles of animals, when they are deprived of a proper amount
of light, become soft and inelastic, the nervous power loses its tone from
defective stimulation, and the elaboration of all growth seems to be
perverted.... In the case of children, constant access to plenty of light
during the day, and to the direct rays of the sun for a part of it, is most
essential to health. Light assists in the elaboration of good plastic blood,
and hardens the fibre after it has been laid down. It also acts as a stimulus
upon the organs of sight, and by this means brings about more activity in the
various cerebral functions.” Dr. W. Strange, Senior Physician of the Worcester
General Hospital, from whose work on “Health” (1864) this passage is taken,
writes in a letter to Mr. White, one of the commissioners: “I have had
opportunities formerly, when in Lancashire, of observing the effects of
nightwork upon children, and I have no hesitation in saying, contrary to what
some employers were fond of asserting, those children who were subjected to it
soon suffered in their health.” (l.c., 284., p. 55.) That such a question
should furnish the material of serious controversy, shows plainly how capitalist
production acts on the brain-functions of capitalists and their retainers.</span></p>

culture of these “labour-powers” must naturally be such as appears in the
following dialogues with one of the commissioners: Jeremiah Haynes, age 12 —
“Four times four is 8; 4 fours are 16. A king is him that has all the money and
gold. We have a king (told it is a Queen), they call her the Princess
Alexandra. Told that she married the Queen’s son. The Queen’s son is the
Princess Alexandra. A Princess is a man.” William Turner, age 12 — “Don’t live
in England. Think it is a country, but didn’t know before.” John Morris, age 14
— “Have heard say that God made the world, and that all the people was drownded
but one, heard say that one was a little bird.” William Smith age 15 — “God
made man, man made woman.” Edward Taylor, age 15 — “Do not know of London.”
Henry Matthewman, age 17 — “Had been to chapel, but missed a good many times
lately. One name that they preached about was Jesus Christ, but I cannot say
any others, and I cannot tell anything about him. He was not killed, but died
like other people. He was not the same as other people in some ways, because he
was religious in some ways and others isn’t.” (l.c., p. xv.) “The devil is a
good person. I don’t know where he lives.” “Christ was a wicked man.” “This
girl spelt God as dog, and did not know the name of the queen.” (“Ch.
Employment Comm. V. Report, 1866” p. 55, n. 278.) The same system obtains in
the glass and paper works as in the metallurgical, already cited. In the paper
factories, where the paper is made by machinery, night-work is the rule for all
processes, except rag-sorting. In some cases night-work, by relays, is carried
on incessantly through the whole week, usually from Sunday night until midnight
of the following Saturday. Those who are on day-work work 5 days of 12, and 1
day of 18 hours; those on night-work 5 nights of 12, and 1 of 6 hours in each
week. In other cases each set works 24 hours consecutively on alternate days,
one set working 6 hours on Monday, and 18 on Saturday to make up the 24 hours.
In other cases an intermediate system prevails, by which all employed on the
paper-making machinery work 15 or 16 hours every day in the week. This system,
says Commissioner Lord, “seems to combine all the evils of both the 12 hours’
and the 24 hours’ relays.” Children under 13, young persons under 18, and
women, work under this night system. Sometimes under the 12 hours’ system they
are obliged, on account of the non-appearance of those that ought to relieve
them, to work a double turn of 24 hours. The evidence proves that boys and
girls very often work overtime, which, not unfrequently, extends to 24 or even 36
hours of uninterrupted toil. In the continuous and unvarying process of glazing
are found girls of 12 who work the whole month 14 hours a day, “without any
regular relief or cessation beyond 2 or, at most, 3 breaks of half an hour each
for meals.” In some mills, where regular night-work has been entirely given up,
over-work goes on to a terrible extent, “and that often in the dirtiest, and in
the hottest, and in the most monotonous of the various processes.” (“Ch.
Employment Comm. Report IV., 1865,” p. xxxviii, and xxxix.)</span></p>

tender scruples of the glass manufacturers that regular meal-times for the
children are impossible because as a consequence a certain quantity of heat,
radiated by the furnaces, would be “a pure loss” or “wasted,” Commissioner
White makes answer. His answer is unlike that of Ure, Senior, &amp;c., and
their puny German plagiarists à la Roscher who are touched by the “abstinence,”
“self-denial,” “saving,” of the capitalists in the expenditure of their gold,
and by their Timur-Tamerlanish prodigality of human life! “A certain amount of
heat beyond what is usual at present might also be going to waste, if
meal-times were secured in these cases, but it seems likely not equal in
money-value to the waste of animal power now going on in glass-houses
throughout the kingdom from growing boys not having enough quiet time to eat
their meals at ease, with a little rest afterwards for digestion.” (l.c., p.
xiv.) And this in the year of progress 1865! Without considering the
expenditure of strength in lifting and carrying, such a child, in the sheds
where bottle and flint glass are made, walks during the performance of his work
15-20 miles in every 6 hours! And the work often lasts 14 or 15 hours! In many
of these glass works, as in the Moscow spinning mills, the system of 6 hours’
relays is in force. “During the working part of the week six hours is the
utmost unbroken period ever attained at any one time for rest, and out of this
has to come the time spent in coming and going to and from work, washing,
dressing, and meals, leaving a very short period indeed for rest, and none for
fresh air and play, unless at the expense of the sleep necessary for young
boys, especially at such hot and fatiguing work.... Even the short sleep is
obviously liable to be broken by a boy having to wake himself if it is night,
or by the noise, if it is day.” Mr. White gives cases where a boy worked 36
consecutive hours; others where boys of 12 drudged on until 2 in the morning,
and then slept in the works till 5 a.m. (3 hours!) only to resume their work.
“The amount of work,” say Tremenheere and Tufnell, who drafted the general
report, “done by boys, youths, girls, and women, in the course of their daily
or nightly spell of labour, is certainly extraordinary.” (l.c., xliii. and
xliv.) Meanwhile, late by night, self-denying Mr. Glass-Capital, primed with
port-wine, reels out of his club homeward droning out idiotically. “Britons
never, never shall be slaves!”</span></p>

rural districts a labourer is condemned to imprisonment for desecrating the
Sabbath, by working in his front garden. The same labourer is punished for
breach of contract if he remains away from his metal, paper, or glass works on
the Sunday, even if it be from a religious whim. The orthodox Parliament will
hear nothing of Sabbath-breaking if it occurs in the process of expanding
capital. A memorial (August 1863), in which the London day-labourers in fish
and poultry shops asked for the abolition of Sunday labour, states that their
work lasts for the first 6 days of the week on an average 15 hours a-day, and
on Sunday 8-10 hours. From this same memorial we learn also that the delicate
gourmands among the aristocratic hypocrites of Exeter Hall, especially
encourage this “Sunday labour.” These “holy ones,” so zealous <em class="calibre4">in cute

of intentions on his part, was “legally” obliged to refuse the requests of the
manufacturers. These gentlemen, however, attained their end through the
obliging nature of the local poor law boards. Mr. A. Redgrave, Inspector of
Factories, asserts that this time the system under which orphans and pauper
children were treated “legally” as apprentices “was not accompanied with the
old abuses” (on these “abuses” see Engels, l.c.), although in one case there
certainly was “abuse of this system in respect to a number of girls and young
women brought from the agricultural districts of Scotland into Lancashire and
Cheshire.” Under this system the manufacturer entered into a contract with the
workhouse authorities for a certain period. He fed, clothed and lodged the
children, and gave them a small allowance of money. A remark of Mr. Redgrave to
be quoted directly seems strange, especially if we consider that even among the
years of prosperity of the English cotton trade, the year 1860 stands
unparalleled, and that, besides, wages were exceptionally high. For this
extraordinary demand for work had to contend with the depopulation of Ireland,
with unexampled emigration from the English and Scotch agricultural districts
to Australia and America, with an actual diminution of the population in some
of the English agricultural districts, in consequence partly of an actual
breakdown of the vital force of the labourers, partly of the already effected
dispersion of the disposable population through the dealers in human flesh.
Despite all this Mr. Redgrave says: “This kind of labour, however, would only
be sought after when none other could be procured, for it is a high-priced
labour. The ordinary wages of a boy of 13 would be about 4s. per week, but to
lodge, to clothe, to feed, and to provide medical attendance and proper
superintendence for 50 or 100 of these boys, and to set aside some remuneration
for them, could not be accomplished for 4s. a-head per week.” (Report of the
Inspector of Factories for 30th April, 1860, p. 27.) Mr. Redgrave forgets to
tell us how the labourer himself can do all this for his children out of their
4s. a-week wages, when the manufacturer cannot do it for the 50 or 100 children
lodged, boarded, superintended all together. To guard against false conclusions
from the text, I ought here to remark that the English cotton industry, since
it was placed under the Factory Act of 1850 with its regulations of
labour-time, &amp;c., must be regarded as the model industry of England. The
English cotton operative is in every respect better off than his Continental
companion in misery. “The Prussian factory operative labours at least ten hours
per week more than his English competitor, and if employed at his own loom in
his own house, his labour is not restricted to even those additional hours.
(“Rep. of Insp. of Fact.,” 31st October, 1855, p. 103.) Redgrave, the Factory
Inspector mentioned above, after the Industrial Exhibition in 1851, travelled
on the Continent, especially in France and Germany, for the purpose of
inquiring into the conditions of the factories. Of the Prussian operative he says:
“He receives a remuneration sufficient to procure the simple fare, and to
supply the slender comforts to which he has been accustomed ... he lives upon
his coarse fare, and works hard, wherein his position is subordinate to that of
the English operative.” (“Rep. of Insp. of Fact.” 31st Oct., 1855, p. 85.)</span></p>

voluntary limitation of working-time for children, &amp;c. “Much as we deplore
the evils before mentioned, it would not be possible to prevent them by any
scheme of agreement between the manufacturers. ... Taking all these points into
consideration, we have come to the conviction that some legislative enactment
is wanted.” (“Children’s Employment Comm.” Rep. I, 1863, p. 322.) Most recently
a much more striking example offers. The rise in the price of cotton during a
period of feverish activity, had induced the manufacturers in Blackburn to
shorten, by mutual consent, the working-time in their mills during a certain
fixed period. This period terminated about the end of November, 1871.
Meanwhile, the wealthier manufacturers, who combined spinning with weaving,
used the diminution of production resulting from this agreement, to extend
their own business and thus to make great profits at the expense of the small
employers. The latter thereupon turned in their extremity to the operatives,
urged them earnestly to agitate for the 9 hours’ system, and promised
contributions in money to this end.</span></p>

indicates a greater degree of independence among the working-classes than
prevails at present; for the board, both of labourers and artificers, would now
be reckoned at a much higher proportion of their wages.” (J. Wade, “History of
the Middle and Working Classes,” pp. 24, 25, and 577.) The opinion that this
difference is due to the difference in the price-relations between food and
clothing then and now is refuted by the most cursory glance at “Chronicon

encouraging Mechanick Industry,” London, 1690, p. 13. Macaulay, who has
falsified English history in the interests of the Whigs and the bourgeoisie,
declares as follows: “The practice of setting children prematurely to work ...
prevailed in the 17th century to an extent which, when compared with the extent
of the manufacturing system, seems almost incredible. At Norwich, the chief
seat of the clothing trade, a little creature of six years old was thought fit
for labour. Several writers of that time, and among them some who were
considered as eminently benevolent, mention with exultation the fact that in that
single city, boys and girls of very tender age create wealth exceeding what was
necessary for their own subsistence by twelve thousand pounds a year. The more
carefully we examine the history of the past, the more reason shall we find to
dissent from those who imagine that our age has been fruitful of new social
evils.... That which is new is the intelligence and the humanity which remedies
them.” (“History of England,” vol. 1., p. 417.) Macaulay might have reported
further that “extremely well-disposed” <em class="calibre4">amis du commerce</em> in the 17th
century, narrate with “exultation” how in a poorhouse in Holland a child of
four was employed, and that this example of “<em class="calibre4">vertu mise en pratique</em>” <span>[applied virtue]</span> passes muster in all the humanitarian
works, <em class="calibre4">à la</em> Macaulay, to the time of Adam Smith. It is true that with
the substitution of manufacture for handicrafts, traces of the exploitation of
children begin to appear. This exploitation existed always to a certain extent
among peasants, and was the more developed, the heavier the yoke pressing on
the husbandman. The tendency of capital is there unmistakably; but the facts
themselves are still as isolated as the phenomena of two-headed children. Hence
they were noted “with exultation” as especially worthy of remark and as wonders
by the far-seeing “<em class="calibre4">amis du commerce</em>,” and recommended as models for
their own time and for posterity. This same Scotch sycophant and fine talker,
Macaulay, says: “We hear to-day only of retrogression and see only progress.”
