same in its developed as in its undeveloped form. In the code which the
influence of the slave-owners, shortly before the outbreak of the American
Civil War, imposed on the territory of New Mexico, it is said that the labourer,
in as much as the capitalist has bought his labour-power, “is his (the
capitalist’s) money.” The same view was current among the Roman patricians. The
money they had advanced to the plebeian debtor had been transformed via the
means of subsistence into the flesh and blood of the debtor. This “flesh and
blood” were, therefore, “their money.” Hence, the Shylock-law of the Ten
Tables. Linguet’s hypothesis that the patrician creditors from time to time
prepared, beyond the Tiber, banquets of debtors’ flesh, may remain as undecided
as that of Daumer on the Christian Eucharist.</span></p>

physically. All medical testimony agrees on this point, and personal
observation at different times has convinced me of it. Nevertheless, and
exclusive of the terrible death-rate of children in the first years of their
life, the official reports of Dr. Greenhow show the unfavourable health
condition of the manufacturing districts as compared with “agricultural
districts of normal health.” As evidence, take the following table from his

an extension of the working day. The hand-mule spinners and self-actor mincers
put an end to the experiment by a petition to their employers in which they
say, “Plainly speaking, our lives are to us a burthen; and, while we are
confined to the mills <em class="calibre4">nearly two days a week more</em> than the other
operatives of the country, we feel like helots in the land, and that we are
perpetuating a system injurious to ourselves and future generations.... This,
therefore, is to give you most respectful notice that when we commence work
again after the Christmas and New Year’s holidays, we shall work 60 hours per

that, in regard to dye and bleachworks, the working day should be fixed on
August 1st, 1861, provisionally at 12 hours, and definitely on August 1st,
1862, at 10 hours, <em class="calibre4">i.e</em>., at 10½ hours for ordinary days, and 7½ for
Saturday. Now, when the fatal year, 1862, came, the old farce was repeated.
Besides, the manufacturers petitioned Parliament to allow the employment of
young persons and women for 12 hours during one year longer. “In the existing
condition of the trade (the time of the cotton famine), it was greatly to the
advantage of the operatives to work 12 hours per day, and make wages when they
could.” A bill to this effect had been brought in, “and it was mainly due to
the action of the operative bleachers in Scotland that the bill was abandoned.”
(Reports, &amp;c., for 31st October, 1862, pp. 14-15.) Thus defeated by the
very workpeople, in whose name it pretended to speak, Capital discovered, with
the help of lawyer spectacles, that the Act of 1860, drawn up, like all the
Acts of Parliament for the “protection of labour,” in equivocal phrases, gave
them a pretext to exclude from its working the calenderers and finishers.
English jurisprudence, ever the faithful servant of capital, sanctioned in the
Court of Common Pleas this piece of pettifogging. “The operatives have been
greatly disappointed ... they have complained of over-work, and it is greatly
to be regretted that the clear intention of the legislature should have failed by
reason of a faulty definition.” (l.c., p. 18.)</span></p>

the law of 1860, by means of the lie that no women worked at it in the night.
The lie was exposed by the Factory Inspectors, and at the same time Parliament
was, by petitions from the operatives, bereft of its notions as to the cool
meadow-fragrance, in which bleaching in the open-air was reported to take
place. In this aerial bleaching, drying-rooms were used at temperatures of from
90° to 100° Fahrenheit, in which the work was done for the most part by girls.
“Cooling” is the technical expression for their occasional escape from the
drying-rooms into the fresh air. “Fifteen girls in stoves. Heat from 80° to 90°
for linens, and 100° and upwards for cambrics. Twelve girls ironing and
doing-up in a small room about 10 feet square, in the centre of which is a
close stove. The girls stand round the stove, which throws out a terrific heat,
and dries the cambrics rapidly for the ironers. The hours of work for these
hands are unlimited. If busy, they work till 9 or 12 at night for successive
nights.” (Reports, &amp;c., for 31st October, 1862, p. 56.) A medical man
states: “No special hours are allowed for cooling, but if the temperature gets
too high, or the workers’ hands get soiled from perspiration, they are allowed
to go out for a few minutes.... My experience, which is considerable, in
treating the diseases of stove workers, compels me to express the opinion that
their sanitary condition is by no means so high as that of the operatives in a
spinning factory (and Capital, in its memorials to Parliament, had painted them
as floridly healthy after the manner of Rubens.) The diseases most observable
amongst them are phthisis, bronchitis, irregularity of uterine functions,
hysteria in its most aggravated forms, and rheumatism. All of these, I believe,
are either directly or indirectly induced by the impure, overheated air of the
apartments in which the hands are employed and the want of sufficient
comfortable clothing to protect them from the cold, damp atmosphere, in winter,
when going to their homes.” (l.c., pp. 56-57.) The Factory Inspectors remarked
on the supplementary law of 1860, torn from these open-air bleachers: “The Act
has not only failed to afford that protection to the workers which it appears
to offer, but contains a clause ... apparently so worded that, unless persons
are detected working after 8 o’clock at night they appear to come under no
protective provisions at all, and if they do so work the mode of proof is so
doubtful that a conviction can scarcely follow.” (l.c., p. 52.) “To all intents
and purposes, therefore, as an Act for any benevolent or educational purpose,
it is a failure; since it can scarcely be called benevolent to permit, which is
tantamount to compelling, women and children to work 14 hours a day with or
without meals, as the case may be, and perhaps for longer hours than these,
without limit as to age, without reference to sex, and without regard to the
social habits of the families of the neighbourhood, in which such works
(bleaching and dyeing) are situated.” (Reports, &amp;c., for 30th April, 1863,
p. 40.)</span></p>

there, 733 are men, 88 women, 135 boys, and 44 girls under 16; in the blast
furnaces, &amp;c., of every 1,000, 668 are men, 149 women, 98 boys, and 85
girls under 16. Add to this the low wages for the enormous exploitation of
mature and immature labour-power. The average daily pay for a man is 2s. 8d.,
for a woman, 1s. 8d., for a boy, 1s. 2½d. As a result, Belgium had in 1863, as

International Statistical Congress at Paris, 1855, it is stated: “The French
law, which limits the length of daily labour in factories and workshops to 12
hours, does not confine this work to definite fixed hours. For children’s
labour only the work-time is prescribed as between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. Therefore,
some of the masters use the right which this fatal silence gives them to keep
their works going, without intermission, day in, day out, possibly with the
exception of Sunday. For this purpose they use two different sets of workers,
of whom neither is in the workshop more than 12 hours at a time, but the work
of the establishment lasts day and night. The law is satisfied, but is
humanity?” Besides “the destructive influence of night-labour on the human
organism,” stress is also laid upon “the fatal influence of the association of
the two sexes by night in the same badly-lighted workshops.”</span></p>

different provisions of these Acts, and the complications arising from them,

which is not very clear to non-chemists, we remark that the author speaks here
of the homologous series of carbon compounds, first so named by C. Gerhardt in
1843, each series of which has its own general algebraic formula. Thus the
series of paraffins: C<sub class="calibre26">n</sub>H<sub class="calibre26">2n+2</sub>, that of the normal
alcohols: C<sub class="calibre26">n</sub>H<sub class="calibre26">2n+2</sub>O; of the normal fatty acids: CnH<sub class="calibre26">2n</sub>O<sub class="calibre26">2</sub>
and many others. In the above examples, by the simply quantitative addition of
CH<sub class="calibre26">2</sub> to the molecular formula, a qualitatively different body is each
time formed. On the share (overestimated by Marx) of Laurent and Gerhardt in

more sharply than previous economists, who had not his polemical interest in

though much his superior as a mathematician and mechanician, treated mechanical
industry from the standpoint of manufacture alone. Ure says, “This
appropriation ... to each, a workman of appropriate value and cost was
naturally assigned, forms the very essence of division of labour.” On the other
hand, he describes this division as “adaptation of labour to the different
talents of men,” and lastly, characterises the whole manufacturing system as “a
system for the division or gradation of labour,” as “the division of labour
into degrees of skill,” &amp;c. (Ure, l.c., pp. 19-23 passim.)</span></p>

of labour in society and in manufacture, was practically illustrated to the
Yankees. One of the new taxes devised at Washington during the civil war, was
the duty of 6% “on all industrial products.” Question: What is an industrial
product? Answer of the legislature: A thing is produced “when it is made,” and
it is made when it is ready for sale. Now, for one example out of many. The New
York and Philadelphia manufacturers had previously been in the habit of
“making” umbrellas with all their belongings. But since an umbrella is a <em class="calibre4">mixtum
compositum</em> of very heterogeneous parts, by degrees these parts became the
products of various separate industries, carried on independently in different
places. They entered as separate commodities into the umbrella manufactory,
where they were fitted together. The Yankees have given to articles thus fitted
together, the name of “assembled articles,” a name they deserve, for being an
assemblage of taxes. Thus the umbrella “assembles,” first, 6% on the price of
each of its elements, and a further 6% on its own total price.</span></p>

various classes and conditions, to their own advantage and to that of the

Plato, division of labour within the community is a development from the

work to the labourer; which latter is unavoidable, if he carries on several
trades at once, thus making one or the other of them subordinate. [“</span><span lang="EL" class="calibre284">Ou gar ethelei to prattomenon ten tou prattonioV scholen

leisure and allow itself to be done in a spare moment. — Yes, he must,— So the
conclusion is that more will be produced of every thing and the work will be
more easily and better done, when every man is set free from all other
occupations to do, at the right time, the one thing for which he is naturally
fitted.] (Rep. 1. 2. Ed. Baiter, Orelli, &amp;c.) So in Thucydides, l.c., c.
142: “Seafaring is an art like any other, and cannot, as circumstances require,
be carried on as a subsidiary occupation; nay, other subsidiary occupations
cannot be carried on alongside of this one.” If the work, says Plato, has to
wait for the labourer, the critical point in the process is missed and the
article spoiled, “</span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre284">ergou cairon diollutai</span><span lang="EN-GB" class="calibre12">.” [If someone lets slip ...] The same Platonic idea is found recurring

much more tasty than other food. “And there is nothing wonderful in this, for
as the other arts are brought to special perfection in the great towns, so the
royal food is prepared in a special way. For in the small towns the same man
makes bedsteads, doors, ploughs, and tables: often, too, he builds houses into
the bargain, and is quite content if he finds custom sufficient for his
sustenance. It is altogether impossible for a man who does so many things to do
them all well. But in the great towns, where each can find many buyers, one
trade is sufficient to maintain the man who carries it on. Nay, there is often
not even need of one complete trade, but one man makes shoes for men, another
for women. Here and there one man gets a living by sewing, another by cutting
out shoes; one does nothing but cut out clothes, another nothing but sew the
pieces together. It follows necessarily then, that he who does the simplest
kind of work, undoubtedly does it better than anyone else. So it is with the
art of cooking.” (Xen. Cyrop. I. viii., c. 2.) Xenophon here lays stress
exclusively upon the excellence to be attained in use-value, although he well
knows that the gradations of the division of labour depend on the extent of the

although very imperfect ones, had already been used, and Italy was probably the
country of their first appearance. A critical history of technology would show
how little any of the inventions of the 18th century are the work of a single
individual. Hitherto there is no such book. Darwin has interested us in the
history of Nature’s Technology, i.e., in the formation of the organs of plants
and animals, which organs serve as instruments of production for sustaining
life. Does not the history of the productive organs of man, of organs that are
the material basis of all social organisation, deserve equal attention? And
would not such a history be easier to compile, since, as Vico says, human
history differs from natural history in this, that we have made the former, but
not the latter? Technology discloses man’s mode of dealing with Nature, the
process of production by which he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare
the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions
that flow from them. Every history of religion, even, that fails to take
account of this material basis, is uncritical. It is, in reality, much easier
to discover by analysis the earthly core of the misty creations of religion,
than, conversely, it is, to develop from the actual relations of life the
corresponding celestialised forms of those relations. The latter method is the
only materialistic, and therefore the only scientific one. The weak points in
the abstract materialism of natural science, a materialism that excludes
history and its process, are at once evident from the abstract and ideological
conceptions of its spokesmen, whenever they venture beyond the bounds of their
own speciality.</span></p>

read before the Society of Arts a paper on “The forces employed in
agriculture.” He there states: “Every improvement that furthers the uniformity
of the land makes the steam-engine more and more applicable to the production
of pure mechanical force.... Horse-power is requisite wherever crooked fences
and other obstructions prevent uniform action. These obstructions are vanishing
day by day. For operations that demand more exercise of will than actual force,
the only power applicable is that controlled every instant by the human mind-in
other words, man-power.” Mr. Morton then reduces steam-power, horse-power, and
man-power, to the unit in general use for steam-engines, namely, the force
required to raise 33,000 lbs. one foot in one minute, and reckons the cost of
one horse-power from a steam-engine to be 3d., and from a horse to be 5½d. per
hour. Further, if a horse must fully maintain its health, it can work no more
than 8 hours a day. Three at the least out of every seven horses used on
tillage land during the year can be dispensed with by using steam-power, at an
expense not greater than that which, the horses dispensed with, would cost
during the 3 or 4 months in which alone they can be used effectively. Lastly,
steam-power, in those agricultural operations in which it can be employed,
improves, in comparison with horse-power, the quality of the work. To do the
work of a steam-engine would require 66 men, at a total cost of 15s. an hour,
and to do the work of a horse, 32 men, at a total cost of 8s. an hour.</span></p>

domestic system of manufacture, yet the mills necessarily situated upon
streams, and frequently at considerable distances the one from the other,
formed part of a rural, rather than an urban system; and it was not until the
introduction of the steam-power as a substitute for the stream that factories
were congregated in towns, and localities where the coal and water required for
the production of steam were found in sufficient quantities. The steam-engine
is the parent of manufacturing towns.” (A. Redgrave in “Reports of the Insp. of

Industry, the wool manufacture was the predominating manufacture in England.
Hence it was in this industry that, in the first half of the 18th century, the
most experiments were made. Cotton, which required less careful preparation for
its treatment by machinery, derived the benefit of the experience gained on
wool, just as afterwards the manipulation of wool by machinery was developed on
the lines of cotton-spinning and weaving by machinery. It was only during the
10 years immediately preceding 1866, that isolated details of the wool
manufacture, such as woolcombing, were incorporated in the factory system. “The
application of power to the process of combing wool ... extensively in
operation since the introduction of the combingmachine, especially Lister’s ...
undoubtedly had the effect of throwing a very large number of men out of work.
Wool was formerly combed by hand, most frequently in the cottage of the comber.
It is now very generally combed in the factory, and hand-labour is superseded,
except in some particular kinds of work, in which hand-combed wool is still
preferred. Many of the hand-combers found employment in the factories, but the
produce of the hand-combers bears so small a proportion to that of the machine,
that the employment of a very large number of combers has passed away.” (“Rep.
of lnsp. of Fact. for 31st Oct., 1856,” p. 16.)</span></p>

modern blowing apparatus of a blast-furnace with the first inefficient
mechanical reproduction of the ordinary bellows, and perhaps more strikingly
than in any other way, by the attempts before the invention of the present
locomotive, to construct a locomotive that actually had two feet, which after
the fashion of a horse, it raised alternately from the ground. It is only after
considerable development of the science of mechanics, and accumulated practical
experience, that the form of a machine becomes settled entirely in accordance

up by machines to the product, and puts machines on the same footing as natural
forces. Thus “Adam Smith nowhere undervalues the services which the natural
agents and machinery perform for us, but he very justly distinguishes the
nature of the value which they add to commodities... as they perform their work
gratuitously, the assistance which they afford us, adds nothing to value in
exchange.” (Ric., l.c., pp. 336, 337.) This observation of Ricardo is of course
correct in so far as it is directed against J. B. Say, who imagines that
machines render the “service” of creating value which forms a part of

of 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, i.e., to a force that raises 33,000 pounds
one foot in a minute, or one pound 33,000 feet. This is the horse power meant
in the text. In ordinary language, and also here and there in quotations in
this work, a distinction is drawn between the “nominal” and the “commercial” or
“indicated” horse-power of the same engine. The old or nominal horse-power is
calculated exclusively from the length of piston-stroke, and the diameter of
the cylinder, and leaves pressure of steam and piston speed out of consideration.
It expresses practically this: This engine would be one of 50 horse-power, if
it were driven with the same low pressure of steam, and the same slow piston
speed, as in the days of Boulton and Watt. But the two latter factors have
increased enormously since those days. In order to measure the mechanical force
exerted today by an engine, an indicator has been invented which shows the
pressure of the steam in the cylinder. The piston speed is easily ascertained.
Thus the “indicated” or “commercial” horse-power of an engine is expressed by a
mathematical formula, involving diameter of cylinder, length of stroke, piston
speed, and steam pressure, simultaneously, and showing what multiple of 33,000
pounds is really raised by the engine in a minute. Hence, one “nominal”
horse-power may exert three, four, or even five “indicated” or “real”
horse-powers. This observation is made for the purpose of explaining various
citations in the subsequent pages. — <em class="calibre4">F. E</em>.</span></p>

constant capital, it cannot add any value under the name of “interest.” It is
also evident that here, where we are treating of the production of surplus-value,
we cannot assume <em class="calibre4">a priori</em> the existence of any part of that value
under the name of interest. The capitalist mode of calculating, which appears, <em class="calibre4">primâ

added by the machinery, decreases both absolutely and relatively, when the

saw with eyes of the manufacturing period, while to eyes of the middle ages,
animals were assistants to man, as they were later to Von Haller in his “</span><span lang="DE">Restauration der Staatswissenschaften</span><span lang="EN-GB">.” That Descartes, like Bacon,
anticipated an alteration in the form of production, and the practical subjugation
of Nature by Man, as a result of the altered methods of thought, is plain from

surround us, as well and as accurately as we know the various trades of our
craftsmen, we shall be able to employ them in the same manner as the latter to

Economy from the old fables and superstitious notions of gold, trade, &amp;c.

as their philosophers; while, at a later period, the philosopher [...] of
Political Economy in England, France, and Italy, was Locke.</span></p>

apart from the banishment of the operatives from the factory atmosphere, the
crisis had several advantages. The women now had sufficient leisure to give
their infants the breast, instead of poisoning them with “Godfrey’s cordial.”
They had time to learn to cook. Unfortunately the acquisition of this art
occurred at a time when they had nothing to cook. But from this we see how
capital, for the purposes of its self-expansion, has usurped the labour
necessary in the home of the family. This crisis was also utilised to teach
sewing to the daughters of the workmen in sewing schools. An American

age, of wages varying from 18 shillings to 45 shillings.” (Th. de Quincey: “The
Logic of Political Econ.,” London, 1844. Note to p. 147.) Since certain family
functions, such as nursing and suckling children, cannot be entirely
suppressed, the mothers confiscated by capital, must try substitutes of some
sort. Domestic work, such as sewing and mending, must be replaced by the
purchase of ready-made articles. Hence, the diminished expenditure of labour in
the house is accompanied by an increased expenditure of money. The cost of
keeping the family increases, and balances the greater income. In addition to
this, economy and judgment in the consumption and preparation of the means of
subsistence becomes impossible. Abundant material relating to these facts,
which are concealed by official Political Economy, is to be found in the

revolting and thoroughly like slave-dealing. But the Pharisee of a capitalist,
as may be seen from the same reports, denounces this brutality which he himself
creates, perpetuates, and exploits, and which he moreover baptises “freedom of
labour.” “Infant labour has been called into aid ... even to work for their own
daily bread. Without strength to endure such disproportionate toil, without
instruction to guide their future life, they have been thrown into a situation
physically and morally polluted. The Jewish historian has remarked upon the

proper (not the Print Works Act referred to in the text) has been in force for
some time, the obstacles in the way of the education clauses have, in recent
years, been overcome. In industries not under the Act, the views of Mr. J.
Geddes, a glass manufacturer, still extensively prevail. He informed Mr. White,
one of the Inquiry Commissioners: “As far as I can see, the greater amount of
education which a part of the working-class has enjoyed for some years past is
an evil. It is dangerous, because it makes them independent.” (“Children’s Empl.

look upon the earliest form of appearance of a thing as the cause of its existence,
are in the habit of attributing the long hours of work in factories to the
extensive kidnapping of children, practised by capitalists in the infancy of
the factory system, on workhouses and orphanages, by means of which robbery,
unresisting material for exploitation was procured. Thus, for instance,
Ficiden, himself a manufacturer, says: “It is evident that the long hours of
work were brought about by the circumstance of so great a number of destitute
children being supplied from different parts of the country, that the masters
were independent of the hands, and that having once established the custom by
means of the miserable materials they had procured in this way, they could
impose it on their neighbours with the greater facility.” (J. Ficiden: “The
Curse of the Factory System,” Lond., 1836, p. I 1.) With reference to the
labour of women, Saunders, the factory inspector, says in his report of 1844:
“Amongst the female operatives there are some women who, for many weeks in
succession, except for a few days, are employed from 6 a. m. till midnight,
with less than 2 hours for meals, so that on 5 days of the week they have only
6 hours left out of the 24, for going to and from their homes and resting in
bed.”</span></p>

commanded the work of the girls to be done by the Nymphs, and now they skip

is for the first time inserted in the report.</span></p>
