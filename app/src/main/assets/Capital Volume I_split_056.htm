Lond., 1861 and 1866. In Lancashire the number of mills increased only 4 per
cent. between 1839 and 1850; 19 per cent. between 1850 and 1856; and 33 per
cent. between 1856 and 1862; while the persons employed in them during each of
the above periods of 11 years increased absolutely, but diminished relatively.
(See “Rep. of Insp. of Fact., for 31st Oct., 1862,” p. 63.) The cotton trade
preponderates in Lancashire. We may form an idea of the stupendous nature of
the cotton trade in that district when we consider that, of the gross number of
textile factories in the United Kingdom, it absorbs 45.2 per cent., of the
spindles 83.3 per cent., of the power-looms 81.4 per cent., of the mechanical
horse-power 72.6 per cent., and of the total number of persons employed 58.2
per cent. (l.c., pp. 62-63.)</span></p>

misleading by statistics (which misleading it would be possible to prove in
detail in other cases too), when the English factory legislation excludes from
its operation the class of labourers last mentioned in the text, while the
parliamentary returns expressly include in the category of factory operatives,
not only engineers, mechanics, &amp;c., but also managers, salesmen,
messengers, warehousemen, packers, &amp;c., in short everybody, except the
owner of the factory himself.</span></p>

of need,” the workmen can be moved at the will of the manager from one machine
to another, and he triumphantly exclaims: “Such a change is in flat
contradiction with the old routine, that divides the labour, and to one workman
assigns the task of fashioning the head of a needle, to another the sharpening
of the point.” He had much better have asked himself, why this “old routine” is
departed from in the automatic factory, only “in case of need. “</span></p>

for instance, during the American Civil War, the factory operative is now and
then set by the Bourgeois to do the roughest of work, such as road-making,
&amp;c.. The English “ateliers nationaux” <span>[national
workshops]</span> of 1862 and the following years, established for the benefit
of the destitute cotton operatives, differ from the French of 1848 in this,
that in the latter the workmen had to do unproductive work at the expense of
the state, in the former they had to do productive municipal work to the
advantage of the bourgeois, and that, too, cheaper than the regular workmen,
with whom they were thus thrown into competition. “The physical appearance of
the cotton operatives is unquestionably improved. This I attribute ... as to
the men, to outdoor labour on public works.” (“Rep. of Insp. of Fact., 31st
Oct., 1863,” p. 59.) The writer here alludes to the Preston factory operatives,
who were employed on Preston Moor.</span></p>

apparatus introduced since the Act of 1844 into woollen mills, for replacing
the labour of children. So soon as it shall happen that the children of the
manufacturers themselves have to go through a course of schooling as helpers in
the mill, this almost unexplored territory of mechanics will soon make
remarkable progress. “Of machinery, perhaps self-acting mules are as dangerous
as any other kind. Most of the accidents from them happen to little children,
from their creeping under the mules to sweep the floor whilst the mules are in
motion. Several ‘minders’ have been fined for this offence, but without much
general benefit. If machine makers would only invent a self-sweeper, by whose
use the necessity for these little children to creep under the machinery might
be prevented, it would be a happy addition to our protective measures.”

uniform motion of mechanism for fifteen hours a day, than when he applies his
physical strength over the same period of time. This labour of surveillance,
which might perhaps serve as a useful exercise for the mind, if it did not go
on too long, destroys both the mind and the body in the long run, through
excessive application]</span> (G. de Molinari: “Études Économiques.” Paris, 1846.)</span></p>

bourgeoisie has bound the proletariat, comes nowhere more plainly into daylight

in fact. The workman must be in the factory at half past five. If he come a few
minutes late, he is punished; if he come 10 minutes late, he is not allowed to
enter until after breakfast, and thus loses a quarter of a day’s wage. He must
eat, drink and sleep at word of command.... The despotic bell calls him from
his bed, calls him from breakfast and dinner. And how does he fare in the mill?
There the master is the absolute law-giver. He makes what regulations he
pleases; he alters and makes additions to his code at pleasure; and if he
insert the veriest nonsense, the courts say to the workman: Since you have
entered into this contract voluntarily, you must now carry it out .... These
workmen are condemned to live, from their ninth year till their death, under
this mental and bodily torture.” (F. Engels, l.c., p. 217, sq.) What, “the
courts say,” I will illustrate by two examples. One occurs at Sheffield at the
end of 1866. In that town a workman had engaged himself for 2 years in a
steelworks. In consequence of a quarrel with his employer he left the works,
and declared that under no circumstances would he work for that master any
more. He was prosecuted for breach of contract, and condemned to two months’
imprisonment. (If the master break the contract, he can be proceeded against
only in a civil action, and risks nothing but money damages.) After the workman
has served his two months, the master invites him to return to the works,
pursuant to the contract. Workman says: No, he has already been punished for
the breach. The master prosecutes again, the court condemns again, although one
of the judges, Mr. Shee, publicly denounces this as a legal monstrosity, by
which a man can periodically, as long as he lives, be punished over and over
again for the same offence or crime. This judgment was given not by the “Great
Unpaid,” the provincial Dogberries, but by one of the highest courts of justice
in London. — [Added <em class="calibre4">in the 4th German edition. — This</em> has now been
done away with. With few exceptions, e.g., when public gas-works are involved,
the worker in England is now put on an equal footing with the employer in case
of breach of contract and can be sued only civilly. — F. E.] The second case
occurs in Wiltshire at the end of November 1863. About 30 power-loom weavers,
in the employment of one Harrup, a cloth manufacturer at Leower’s Mill,
Westbury Leigh, struck work because master Harrup indulged in the agreeable
habit of making deductions from their wages for being late in the morning; 6d.
for 2 minutes; 1s. for 3 minutes, and 1s. 6d. for ten minutes. This is at the
rate of 9s. per hour, and £4 10s. 0d. per diem; while the wages of the weavers
on the average of a year, never exceeded 10s. to 12s. weekly. Harrup also
appointed a boy to announce the starting time by a whistle, which he often did
before six o’clock in the morning: and if the hands were not all there at the
moment the whistle ceased, the doors were closed, and those hands who were
outside were fined: and as there was no clock on the premises, the unfortunate
hands were at the mercy of the young Harrup-inspired time-keeper. The hands on
strike, mothers of families as well as girls, offered to resume work if the
timekeeper were replaced by a clock, and a more reasonable scale of fines were
introduced. Harrup summoned I9 women and girls before the magistrates for
breach of contract. To the utter indignation of all present, they were each
mulcted in a fine of 6d. and 2s. 6d. for costs. Harrup was followed from the
court by a crowd of people who hissed him. A favourite operation with
manufacturers is to punish the workpeople by deductions made from their wages
on account of faults in the material worked on. This method gave rise in 1866
to a general strike in the English pottery districts. The reports of the Ch.
Empl. Com. (1863-1866), give cases where the worker not only receives no wages,
but becomes, by means of his labour, and of the penal regulations, the debtor
to boot, of his worthy master. The late cotton crisis also furnished edifying
examples of the sagacity shown by the factory autocrats in making deductions
from wages. Mr. R. Baker, the Inspector of Factories, says, “I have myself had
lately to direct prosecutions against one cotton mill occupier for having in
these pinching and painful times deducted 10d. a piece from some of the young
workers employed by him, for the surgeon’s certificate (for which he himself
had only paid 6d.), when only allowed by the law to deduct 3d., and by custom
nothing at all .... And I have been informed of another, who, in order to keep
without the law, but to attain the same object, charges the poor children who
work for him a shilling each, as a fee for learning them the art and mystery of
cotton spinning, so soon as they are declared by the surgeon fit and proper
persons for that occupation. There may therefore be undercurrent causes for
such extraordinary exhibitions as strikes, not only wherever they arise, but
particularly at such times as the present, which without explanation, render
them inexplicable to the public understanding.” He alludes here to a strike of
power-loom weavers at Darwen, June, 1863. (“Reports of Insp. of Fact. for 30
April, 1863,” pp. 50-51.) The reports always go beyond their official dates.</span></p>

Factory Acts against dangerous machinery has had a beneficial effect. “But ...
there are other sources of accident which did not exist twenty years since; one
especially, viz., the increased speed of the machinery. Wheels, rollers,
spindles and shuttles are now propelled at increased and increasing rates;
fingers must be quicker and defter in their movements to take up the broken
thread, for, if placed with hesitation or carelessness, they are sacrificed....
A large number of accidents are caused by the eagerness of the workpeople to
get through their work expeditiously. It must be remembered that it is of the
highest importance to manufacturers that their machinery should be in motion,
i.e., producing yarns and goods. Every minute’s stoppage is not only a loss of
power, but of production, and the workpeople are urged by the overlookers, who
are interested in the quantity of work turned off, to keep the machinery in
motion, and it is no less important to those of the operatives who are paid by
the weight or piece, that the machines should be kept in motion. Consequently,
although it is strictly forbidden in many, nay in most factories, that
machinery should be cleaned while in motion, it is nevertheless the constant
practice in most, if not in all, that the workpeople do, unreproved, pick out
waste, wipe rollers and wheels, &amp;c., while their frames are in motion. Thus
from this cause only, 906 accidents have occurred during the six months....
Although a great deal of cleaning is constantly going on day by day, yet
Saturday is generally the day set apart for the thorough cleaning of the
machinery, and a great deal of this is done while the machinery is in motion.”
Since cleaning is not paid for, the workpeople seek to get done with it as
speedily as possible. Hence “the number of accidents which occur on Fridays,
and especially on Saturdays, is much larger than on any other day. On the
former day the excess is nearly 12 per cent. over the average number of the
four first days of the week, and on the latter day the excess is 25 per cent.
over the average of the preceding five days; or, if the number of working-hours
on Saturday being taken into account — 7½ hours on Saturday as compared with
10½ on other days — there is an excess of 65 per cent. on Saturdays over the
average of the other five days.” (“Rep. of Insp. of Fact., 31st Oct., 1866,”

give an account of a recent campaign by the English manufacturers against the
Clauses in the Factory Acts that protect the “hands” against dangerous
machinery. For the present, let this one quotation from the official report of
Leonard Horner suffice: “I have heard some mill-owners speak with inexcusable
levity of some of the accidents; such, for instance, as the loss of a finger
being a trifling matter. A working-man’s living and prospects depend so much
upon his fingers, that any loss of them is a very serious matter to him. When I
have heard such inconsiderate remarks made, I have usually put this question:
Suppose you were in want of an additional workman, and two were to apply, both
equally well qualified in other respects, but one had lost a thumb or a
forefinger, which would you engage? There never was a hesitation as to the
answer....” The manufacturers have “mistaken prejudices against what they have
heard represented as a pseudo-philanthropic legislation.” (“Rep. of Insp. of
Fact., 31st Oct., 1855.") These manufacturers are clever folk, and not
without reason were they enthusiastic for the slave-holders’ rebellion.</span></p>

labour of an individual; more time would be lost in its construction than could
be saved by its application. It is only really useful when it acts on great
masses, when a single machine can assist the work of thousands. It is
accordingly in the most populous countries, where there are most idle men, that
it is most abundant.... It is not called into use by a scarcity of men, but by
the facility with which they can be brought to work in masses.” (Piercy

hand-weaving and power-weaving in England, before the passing of the Poor Law
of 1833, was prolonged by supplementing the wages, which had fallen
considerably below the minimum, with parish relief. “The Rev. Mr. Turner was,
in 1827, rector of Wilmslow in Cheshire, a manufacturing district. The
questions of the Committee of Emigration, and Mr. Turner’s answers, show how
the competition of human labour is maintained against machinery. ‘Question: Has
not the use of the power-loom superseded the use of the hand-loom? Answer:
Undoubtedly; it would have superseded them much more than it has done, if the
hand-loom weavers were not enabled to submit to a reduction of wages.’
‘Question: But in submitting he has accepted wages which are insufficient to
support him, and looks to parochial contribution as the remainder of his
support? Answer: Yes, and in fact the competition between the hand-loom and the
power-loom is maintained out of the poor-rates.’ Thus degrading pauperism or
expatriation, is the benefit which the industrious receive from the
introduction of machinery, to be reduced from the respectable and in some
degree independent mechanic, to the cringing wretch who lives on the debasing
bread of charity. This they call a temporary inconvenience.” (“A Prize Essay on

after the termination of the American Civil War, and almost in no time, to glut
the markets of the world again. Cloth, during the last six months of 1866, was
almost unsaleable. Thereupon began the consignment of goods to India and China,
thus naturally making the glut more intense. At the beginning of 1867 the
manufacturers resorted to their usual way out of the difficulty, viz., reducing
wages 5 per cent. The workpeople resisted, and said that the only remedy was to
work short time, 4 days a-week; and their theory was the correct one. After

the final result of the factory system to be an absolutely less number of
operatives, at whose expense an increased number of “gens honnêtes” live and
develop their well-known “perfectibilité perfectible.” Little as he understands
the movement of production, at least he feels, that machinery must needs be a
very fatal institution, if its introduction converts busy workmen into paupers,
and its development calls more slaves of labour into existence than it has suppressed.
It is not possible to bring out the cretinism of his standpoint, except by his
own words: “</span><span lang="FR">Les classes
condamnées à produire et à consommer diminuent, et les classes qui dirigent le
travail, qui soulagent, consolent, et éclairent toute la population, se
multiplient ... et s’approprient tous les bienfaits qui résultent de la
diminution des frais du travail, de l’abondance des productions, et du bon
marché des consommations. Dans cette direction, l’espéce humaine s’élève aux
plus hautes conceptions du génie, pénètre dans les profoundeurs mystérieuses de
la religion, établit les principes salutaires de la morale (which consists in
‘s’approprier tous les beinfaits,’ &amp;c.), les lois tutélaires de la liberté
(liberty of ‘les classes condamnées à produire?’) et du pouvoir, de
l’obéissance et de la justice, du devoir et de la l’humanité</span><span lang="EN-GB">.” <span>[The classes
condemned to produce and to consume diminish, and the classes which direct
labour, which relieve, console and enlighten the whole population, multiply ...
and appropriate all the benefits which result from the diminution of the costs
of labour, from the abundance of products and the cheapness of consumer goods.
In this way, the human species rises to the highest creations of genius,
penetrates the mysterious depths of religion, and establishes the salutory
principles of morality, the laws for the protection of liberty, and power, of
obedience and justice, of obligation and humanity]</span> For this twaddle, see

the Trade Societies of England, by the shoemakers of Leicester, who had been
thrown on the streets by a lock-out, it is stated: “Twenty years ago the
Leicester shoe trade was revolutionised by the introduction of riveting in the
place of stitching. At that time good wages could be earned. Great competition
was shown between the different firms as to which could turn out the neatest
article. Shortly afterwards, however a worse kind of competition sprang up,
namely, that of underselling one another in the market. The injurious
consequences soon manifested themselves in reductions of wages, and so
sweepingly quick was the fall in the price of labour, that many firms now pay
only one half of the original wages. And yet, though wages sink lower and
lower, profits appear, with each alteration in the scale of wages, to
increase.” Even bad times are utilised by the manufacturers, for making
exceptional profits by excessive lowering of wages, i.e., by a direct robbery
of the labourer’s means of subsistence. One example (it has reference to the
crisis in the Coventry silk weaving): “From information I have received from
manufacturers as well as workmen, there seems to be no doubt that wages have
been reduced to a greater extent than either the competition of the foreign
producers, or other circumstances have rendered necessary ... the majority of
weavers are working at a reduction of 30 to 40 per cent. in their wages. A
piece of ribbon for making which the weaver got 6s. or 7s. five years back, now
only brings them 3s. 3d. or 3s. 6d.; other work is now priced at 2s. and 2s.
3d. which was formerly priced at 4s. and 4s. 3d. The reduction in wage seems to
have been carried to a greater extent than is necessary for increasing demand.
Indeed, the reduction in the cost of weaving, in the case of many descriptions
of ribbons, has not been accompanied by any corresponding reduction in the
selling price of the manufactured article.” (Mr. F. D. Longe’s Report. “Ch.
Emp. Com., V. Rep., 1866,” p. 114, 1.)</span></p>

factory operatives of Lancashire, &amp;c., for the purpose of forming a society
for organised emigration, we find the following: “That a large emigration of
factory workers is now absolutely essential to raise them from their present
prostrate condition, few will deny; but to show that a continuous stream of
emigration is at all times demanded, and, without which it is impossible for
than to maintain their position in ordinary times, we beg to call attention to
the subjoined facts: — In 1814 the official value of cotton goods exported was
£17,665,378, whilst the real marketable value was £20,070,824. In 1858 the
official value of cotton goods exported, was £182,221,681; but the real or
marketable value was only £43,001,322, being a ten-fold quantity sold for
little more than double the former price. To produce results so disadvantageous
to the country generally, and to the factory workers in particular, several
causes have co-operated, which, had circumstances permitted, we should have
brought more prominently under your notice; suffice it for the present to say
that the most obvious one is the constant redundancy of labour, without which a
trade so ruinous in its effects never could have been carried on, and which
requires a constantly extending market to save it from annihilation. Our cotton
mills may be brought to a stand by the periodical stagnations of trade, which,
under present arrangements, are as inevitable as death itself; but the human
mind is constantly at work, and although we believe we are under the mark in
stating that six millions of persons have left these shores during the last 25
years, yet, from the natural increase of population, and the displacement of
labour to cheapen production, a large percentage of the male adults in the most
prosperous times find it impossible to obtain work in factories on any
conditions whatever.” (“Reports of Insp. of Fact., 30th April 1863,” pp.
51-52.) We shall, in a later chapter, see how our friends, the manufacturers,
endeavoured, during the catastrophe in the cotton trade, to prevent by every
means, including State interference, the emigration of the operatives.</span></p>

and “improvers,” who come for the purpose of being perfected in their trade.
These figure in the census as Londoners, they swell out the number of heads on

keep the journeymen employed before the spring comes, and they know what the
fashion will then be; 2ndly, In the spring the journeymen are not sufficient,

of the kingdom in a quarter or half a year, which robs the plough of hands,
drains the country of labourers, and in a great part stocks the city with

revolution it effects in the mode of production and in the social conditions of
production, of also revolutionising people’s minds, is strikingly shown by a
comparison of Senior’s speech in 1863, with his philippic against the Factory
Act of 1833; or by a comparison, of the views of the congress above referred
to, with the fact that in certain country districts of England poor parents are
forbidden, on pain of death by starvation, to educate their children. Thus,
e.g., Mr. Snell reports it to be a common occurrence in Somersetshire that,
when a poor person claims parish relief, he is compelled to take his children
from school. Mr. Wollarton, the clergyman at Feltham, also tells of cases where

driven by men, compete directly or indirectly with more developed machines driven
by mechanical power, a great change takes place with regard to the labourer who
drives the machine. At first the steam-engine replaces this labourer,
afterwards he must replace the steam-engine. Consequently the tension and the
amount of tambour-power expended become monstrous, and especially so in the
case of the children who are condemned to this torture. Thus Mr. Longe; one of
the commissioners, found in Coventry and the neighbourhood boys of from 10 to
15 years employed in driving the ribbon-looms, not to mention younger children
who had to drive smaller machines. “It is extraordinarily fatiguing work. The
boy is a mere substitute for steam power.” (“Ch. Empl. Comm. V, Rep. 1866;” p.

be theoretically the starting-point of the social revolution. Herr Vissering,
Professor of Political Economy in the University of Leyden, appears to have a

<p class="MsoNormal"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN-GB">[<em class="calibre4">Added
in the 4th German edition</em></span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> — The “hopelessly bewildering tangle of contradictory enactments” (S.
314) (present volume, p. 284) which English legislation called into life by
means of the mutually conflicting Factory Acts, the Factory Acts Extension Act
and the Workshops’ Act, finally became intolerable, and thus all legislative
enactments on this subject were codified in the Factory and Workshop Act of
1878. Of course no detailed critique of this English industrial code now in
effect can be presented here. The following remarks will have to suffice. The
Act comprises: </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">1) <b class="calibre1">Textile
Mills</b>. Here everything remains about as it was: children more than 10 years
of age may work 5½ hours a day; or 6 hours and Saturday off; young persons and
women, 10 hours on 5 days, and at most 6½ on Saturday. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">2) <b class="calibre1">Non-Textile
Factories</b>. Here the regulations are brought closer than before to those of
No. 1, but there are still several exceptions which favour the capitalists and
which in certain cases may be expanded by special permission of the Home
Secretary. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">3) <b class="calibre1">Workshops</b>,
defined approximately as in the former Act; as for the children, young workers
and women employed there, the workshops are about on a par with the non-textile
factories, but again conditions are easier in details. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">4) <b class="calibre1">Workshops</b>
in which no children or young workers are employed, but only persons of both
sexes above the age of 18; this category enjoy still easier conditions. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">5) <b class="calibre1">Domestic
Workshops</b>, where only members of the family are employed, in the family
dwelling: still more elastic regulations and simultaneously the restriction
that the inspector may, without special permission of the ministry or a court,
enter only rooms not used also for dwelling purposes; and lastly unrestricted
freedom for straw-plaiting and lace and glove-making by members of the family.
With all its defects this Act, together with the Swiss Federal Factory Law of
March 23, 1877, is still by far the best piece of legislation in this field. A
comparison of it with the said Swiss federal law is of particular interest
because it clearly demonstrates the merits and demerits of the two legislative
methods — the English, “historical” method, which intervenes when occasion
requires, and the continental method, which is built up on the traditions of
the French Revolution and generalises more. Unfortunately, due to insufficient
inspection personnel, the English code is still largely a dead letter with
regard to its application to workshops. <em class="calibre4">— F. E.</em>] </span></p>

Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie,” 7. Auflage, 1862, and especially the
“Einleitung in die Naturgesetze des Feldbaus,” in the 1st Volume. To have
developed from the point of view of natural science, the negative, i.e.,
destructive side of modern agriculture, is one of Liebig’s immortal merits. His
summary, too, of the history of agriculture, although not free from gross
errors, contains flashes of light. It is, however, to be regretted that he
ventures on such haphazard assertions as the following: “By greater pulverising
and more frequent ploughing, the circulation of air in the interior of porous
soil is aided, and the surface exposed to the action of the atmosphere is
increased and renewed; but it is easily seen that the increased yield of the
land cannot be proportional to the labour spent on that land, but increases in
a much smaller proportion. This law,” adds Liebig, “was first enunciated by
John Stuart Mill in his ‘Principles of Pol. Econ.,’ Vol. 1, p. 17, as follows:
‘That the produce of land increases, <em class="calibre4">caeteris paribus</em>, in a
diminishing ratio to the increase of the labourers employed’ (Mill here
introduces in an erroneous form the law enunciated by Ricardo’s school, for
since the ‘decrease of the labourers employed,’ kept even pace in England with
the advance of agriculture, the law discovered in, and applied to, England,
could have no application to that country, at all events), ‘is the universal
law of agricultural industry.’ This is very remarkable, since Mill was ignorant
of the reason for this law.” (Liebig, l.c., Bd. I., p. 143 and Note.) Apart
from Liebig’s wrong interpretation of the word “labour,” by which word he
understands something quite different from what Political Economy does, it is,
in any case, “very remarkable” that he should make Mr. John Stuart Mill the
first propounder of a theory which was first published by James Anderson in A.
Smith’s days, and was repeated in various works down to the beginning of the
19th century; a theory which Malthus, that master in plagiarism (the whole of
his population theory is a shameless plagiarism), appropriated to himself in
1815; which West developed at the same time as, and independently of, Anderson;
which in the year 1817 was connected by Ricardo with the general theory of
value, then made the round of the world as Ricardo’s theory, and in 1820 was
vulgarised by James Mill, the father of John Stuart Mill; and which, finally,
was reproduced by John Stuart Mill and others, as a dogma already quite
commonplace, and known to every schoolboy. It cannot be denied that John Stuart
Mill owes his, at all events, “remarkable” authority almost entirely to such <em class="calibre4">quid-pro-quos</em>.</span></p>

through necessity cannot be the same, nor is it practicable to ascertain the
degree of variation farther than by the degrees of Heat and Cold; from whence

made, amongst others, this absurd addition, that a rise in surplus-value,

abolition of taxes payable by the capitalist. The abolition of such taxes makes
no change whatever in the quantity of surplus-value that the capitalist extorts
at first-hand from the labourer. It alters only the proportion in which that surplus-value
is divided between himself and third persons. It consequently makes no
alteration whatever in the relation between surplus-value and value of
labour-power. MacCulloch's exception therefore proves only his misapprehension

abreast; but there is an obvious limit, beyond which they cannot be separated.
With regard to the unusual exertions made by the labouring classes in periods
of dearness, which produce the fall of wages noticed in the evidence” (namely,
before the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry, 1814-15), “they are most
meritorious in the individuals, and certainly favour the growth of capital. But
no man of humanity could wish to see them constant and unremitted. They are
most admirable as a temporary relief; but if they were constantly in action,
effects of a similar kind would result from them, as from the population of a
country being pushed to the very extreme limits of its food.” (Malthus:
“Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent,” Lond., 1815, p. 48, note.) All
honour to Malthus that he lays stress on the lengthening of the hours of
labour, a fact to which he elsewhere in his pamphlet draws attention, while
Ricardo and others, in face of the most notorious facts, make invariability in
the length of the working day the groundwork of all their investigations. But
the conservative interests, which Malthus served, prevented him from seeing
that an unlimited prolongation of the working day, combined with an
extraordinary development of machinery, and the exploitation of women and
children, must inevitably have made a great portion of the working-class
“supernumerary,” particularly whenever the war should have ceased, and the monopoly
of England in the markets of the world should have come to an end. It was, of
course, far more convenient, and much more in conformity with the interests of
the ruling classes, whom Malthus adored like a true priest, to explain this
“over-population” by the eternal laws of Nature, rather than by the historical
laws of capitalist production.</span></p>

must be rescued not only from labor, but from itself, and that will be best
effected, by treating the acts of the industrial capitalist as economic and
political functions, that have been delegated to him with his capital, and by
treating his profit as a form of salary, because we still know no other social
organisation. But salaries may be regulated, and may also be reduced if they
take too much from wages. The irruption of Marx into Society, as I may call his
book, must be warded off.... Altogether, Marx’s book is not so much an
investigation into capital, as a polemic against the present form of capital, a
form which he confounds with the concept itself of capital.” <br class="calibre7"/>

by the quantity of labour required to produce wages; by which he means the
quantity of labour required to produce the money or commodities given to the

explain such expressions as merely poetic license only shows the impotence of
the analysis. Hence, in answer to Proudhon’s phrase; “Labour is called value,
not as being a commodity itself, but in view of the values supposed to be
potentially embodied in it. The value of labour is a figurative expression,”
&amp;c. I have remarked: “In labour, commodity, which is a frightful reality,
he (Proudhon) sees nothing but a grammatical ellipsis. The whole of existing
society, then, based upon labour commodity, is henceforth based upon a poetic
license, on a figurative expression. Does society desire to eliminate all the
inconveniences which trouble it, it has only to eliminate all the ill-sounding terms.
Let it change the language, and for that it has only to address itself to the
Academy and ask it for a new edition of its dictionary.” (Karl Marx, “Misère de
la Philosophie,” pp. 34, 35.) It is naturally still more convenient to
understand by value nothing at all. Then one can without difficulty subsume
everything under this category. Thus, e.g., J. B. Say: “What is value?” Answer:
“That which a thing is worth"; and what is “price"? Answer: “The
value of a thing expressed in money.” And why has agriculture a value? Answer:
“Because one sets a price on it.” Therefore value is what a thing is worth, and
the land has its “value,” because its value is “expressed in money.” This is,
anyhow, a very simple way of explaining the why and the wherefore of things.</span></p>

of 15, as of 6 hours. The normal price of labour is in the first case
calculated on the labourer working 15 hours, in the second case on his working
6 hours a day on the average. The result is therefore the same, if he in the
one case is employed only for 7½, in the other only for 3 hours.</span></p>

introduction of the Factory Act in 1862) “was carried on by a system of over-time,
i.e., ten hours a day were the regular hours of work, for which a nominal wage
of 1s. 2d. per day was paid to a man, there being every day over-time for three
or four hours, paid at the rate of 3d. per hour. The effect of this system ...
a man could not earn more than 8s. per week when working the ordinary hours ...
without over-time they could not earn a fair day’s wages.” (“Rept. of Insp. of

males to work longer hours, are a temptation too strong to be resisted.”
(“Rept. of Insp. of Fact.,” April 30th, 1848, p. 5.) The book-binding trade in
the city of London employs very many young girls from 14 to 15 years old, and
that under indentures which prescribe certain definite hours of labour.
Nevertheless, they work in the last week of each month until 10, 11, 12, or 1
o’clock at night, along with the older labourers, in a very mixed company. “The
masters tempt them by extra pay and supper,” which they eat in neighboring
public houses. The great debauchery thus produced among these “young immortals”

work equally long with the others, and get no more money for their
over-time.... The work of these 200 people for half an hour a day is equal to
one person’s work for 50 hours, or 5/6’s of one person’s labour in a week, and
is a positive gain to the employer.” (“Reports of Insp. of Fact., 31st Oct.,
1860,” p. 9.) “Over-working to a very considerable extent still prevails; and,
in most instances, with that security against detection and punishment which
the law itself affords. I have in many former reports shown ... the injury to

translation from the English, but the English edition: “The Analysis of Trade,
Commerce, &amp;c.,” by Philip Cantillon, late of the city of London, Merchant,
is not only of later date (1759), but proves by its contents that it is a later
and revised edition: e.g., in the French edition, Hume is not yet mentioned,
whilst in the English, on the other hand, Petty hardly figures any longer. The
English edition is theoretically less important, but it contains numerous
details referring specifically to English commerce, bullion trade, &amp;c.,

polemic against Adam Smith: “It deserves, likewise, to be remarked, that
although the apparent price of Labour is usually lower in poor countries, where
the produce of the soil, and grain in general, is cheap; yet it is in fact for
the most part really higher than in other countries. For it is not the wages
that is given to the labourer per day that constitutes the real price of
labour, although it is its apparent price. The real price is that which a
certain quantity of work performed actually costs the employer; and considered
in this light, labour is in almost all cases cheaper in rich countries than in
those that are poorer, although the price of grain and other provisions is
usually much lower in the last than in the first.... Labour estimated by the
day is much lower in Scotland than in England.... Labour by the piece is
generally cheaper in England.” (James Anderson, “Observations on the Means of
Exciting a Spirit of National Industry,” &amp;tc., Edin. 1777, pp. 350, 351.)
On the contrary, lowness of wages produces, in its turn, dearness of labour. “Labour
being dearer in Ireland than it is in England ... because the wages are so much
lower.” (N. 2079 in “Royal Commission on Railways, Minutes,” 1867.)</span></p>

wealth has acquired the power of reproducing itself through the labour of

which circumstances do not secure to the farmer undisputed proprietary rights
over the agricultural labourer. The mining industry allows the latter some
choice. In this county, the farmer, contrary to the custom elsewhere, rents
only such farms as have on them labourers’ cottages. The rent of the cottage is
a part of the wages. These cottages are known as “hinds’ houses.” They are let
to the labourers in consideration of certain feudal services, under a contract
called “bondage,” which, amongst other things, binds the labourer, during the
time he is employed elsewhere, to leave some one, say his daughter, &amp;c., to
supply his place. The labourer himself is called a “bondsman.” The relationship
here set up also shows how individual consumption by the labourer becomes
consumption on behalf of capital - or productive consumption - from
quite a new point of view: “It is curious to observe that the very dung of the
hind and bondsman is the perquisite of the calculating lord ... and the lord
will allow no privy but his own to exist in the neighbourhood, and will rather
give a bit of manure here and there for a garden than bate any part of his
