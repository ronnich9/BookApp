Mill never detects even such faulty analysis as this when made by his

science, cries out for rectification. In every case he registers with the
dogmatism of a disciple, the confusion of his master’s thoughts. So here: “The
capital itself in the long run becomes entirely wages, and when replaced by the

of reproduction, and of accumulation, Adam Smith, in many ways, not only made
no advance, but even lost considerable ground, compared with his predecessors,
especially by the Physiocrats. Connected with the illusion mentioned in the
text, is the really wonderful dogma, left by him as an inheritance to Political
Economy, the dogma, that the price of commodities is made up of wages, profit
(interest) and rent, <em class="calibre4">i.e., </em>of wages and surplus-value. Starting from
this basis, Storch naively confesses, “Il est impossible de résoudre le prix
nécessaire dans ses éléments les plus simples.” <span>[... it is
impossible to resolve the necessary price into its simplest elements]</span>
(Storch, l. c., Petersb. Edit., 1815, t. ii., p. 141, note.) A fine science of
economy this, which declares it impossible to resolve the price of a commodity
into its simplest elements! This point will be further investigated in the
seventh part of Book iii.</span></p>

word revenue is used in a double sense: first, to designate surplus-value so
far as it is the fruit periodically yielded by capital; secondly, to designate
the part of that fruit which is periodically consumed by the capitalist, or
added to the fund that supplies his private consumption. I have retained this
double meaning because it harmonises with the language of the English and
French economists.</span></p>

old-fashioned but ever renewed specimen of the capitalist for his text, Luther
shows very aptly that the love of power is an element in the desire to get
rich. “The heathen were able, by the light of reason, to conclude that a usurer
is a double-dyed thief and murderer. We Christians, however, hold them in such
honour, that we fairly worship them for the sake of their money.... Whoever
eats up, robs, and steals the nourishment of another, that man commits as great
a murder (so far as in him lies) as he who starves a man or utterly undoes him.
Such does a usurer, and sits the while safe on his stool, when he ought rather
to be hanging on the gallows, and be eaten by as many ravens as he has stolen
guilders, if only there were so much flesh on him, that so many ravens could stick
their beaks in and share it. Meanwhile, we hang the small thieves.... Little
thieves are put in the stocks, great thieves go flaunting in gold and silk....
Therefore is there, on this earth, no greater enemy of man (after the devil)
than a gripe-money, and usurer, for he wants to be God over all men. Turks,
soldiers, and tyrants are also bad men, yet must they let the people live, and
Confess that they are bad, and enemies, and do, nay, must, now and then show
pity to some. But a usurer and money-glutton, such a one would have the whole
world perish of hunger and thirst, misery and want, so far as in him lies, so
that he may have all to himself, and every one may receive from him as from a
God, and be his serf for ever. To wear fine cloaks, golden chains, rings, to
wipe his mouth, to be deemed and taken for a worthy, pious man .... Usury is a
great huge monster, like a werewolf, who lays waste all, more than any Cacus,
Gerion or Antus. And yet decks himself out, and would be thought pious, so that
people may not see where the oxen have gone, that he drags backwards into his
den. But Hercules shall hear the cry of the oxen and of his prisoners, and
shall seek Cacus even in cliffs and among rocks, and shall set the oxen loose
again from the villain. For Cacus means the villain that is a pious usurer, and
steals, robs, eats everything. And will not own that he has done it, and thinks
no one will find him out, because the oxen, drawn backwards into his den, make
it seem, from their foot-prints, that they have been let out. So the usurer
would deceive the world, as though he were of use and gave the world oxen,
which he, however, rends, and eats all alone... And since we break on the
wheel, and behead highwaymen, murderers and housebreakers, how much more ought
we to break on the wheel and kill.... hunt down, curse and behead all usurers.”
(Martin Luther, l. c.)</span></p>

del’Écon. Pol.” trad. Arrivabene. Paris, 1836, p. 308.) This was rather too
much for the adherents of the old classical school. “Mr. Senior has substituted
for it” (the expression, labour and profit) “the expression labour and
Abstinence. He who converts his revenue abstains from the enjoyment which its
expenditure would afford him. It is not the capital, but the use of the capital
productively, which is the cause of profits.” (John Cazenove, l. c., p. 130,
Note.) John St. Mill, on the contrary, accepts on the one hand Ricardo’s theory
of profit, and annexes on the other hand Senior’s “remuneration of abstinence.”
He is as much at home in absurd contradictions, as he feels at sea in the Hegelian
contradiction, the source of all dialectic. It has never occurred to the vulgar
economist to make the simple reflexion, that every human action may be viewed,
as “abstinence” from its opposite. Eating is abstinence from fasting, walking,
abstinence from standing still, working, abstinence from idling, idling,
abstinence from working, &amp;c. These gentlemen would do well, to ponder, once
in a while, over Spinoza’s: “Determinatio est Negatio.”</span></p>

a deficient analysis of the labour process, and of the process of creating
value, never properly grasped this weighty element of reproduction, as may be
seen in Ricardo; he says, <em class="calibre4">e.g.</em>, whatever the change in productive
power, “a million men always produce in manufactures the same value.” This is
accurate, if the extension and degree of intensity of their labour are given.
But it does not prevent (this Ricardo overlooks in certain conclusions he
draws) a million men with different powers of productivity in their labour,
turning into products very different masses of the means of production, and
therefore preserving in their products very different masses of value; in
consequence of which the values of the products yielded may vary considerably.
Ricardo has, it may be noted in passing, tried in vain to make clear to J. B.
Say, by that very example, the difference between use value (which he here
calls wealth or material riches) and exchange-value. Say answers: “Quant à la
difficulté qu’élève Mr. Ricardo en disant que, par des procédés mieux entendus
un million de personnes peuvent produire deux fois, trois fois autant de
richesses, sans produire plus de valeurs, cette difficulté n’est pas une
lorsque l’on considére, ainsi qu’on le doit, la production comme un échange
dans lequel on donne les services productifs de son travail, de sa terre, et de
ses capitaux, pour obtenir des produits. C’est par le moyen de ces services
productifs, que nous acquérons tous les produits qui sont au monde. Or... nous
sommes d’autant plus riches, nos services productifs ont d’autant plus de
valeur qu’ils obtiennent dans l’échange appelé production une plus grande
quantité de choses utiles.” <span>[As for the difficulty raised
by Ricardo when he says that, by using better methods of production, a million
people can produce two or three times as much wealth, without producing any
more value, this difficulty disappears when one bears in mind, as one should,
that production is like an exchange in which a man contributes the productive
services of his labour, his land, and his capital, in order to obtain products.
It is by means of these productive services that we acquire all the products
existing in the world. Therefore ... we are richer, our productive services
have the more value, the greater the quantity of useful things they bring in
through the exchange which is called production]</span> (J. B. Say, “Lettres à
M. Malthus,” Paris, 1820, pp. 168, 169.) The “difficulté” — it exists for him,
not for Ricardo — that Say means to clear up is this: Why does not the
exchange-value of the use values increase, when their quantity increases in
consequence of increased productive power of labour? Answer: the difficulty is
met by calling use value, exchange-value, if you please. Exchange-value is a
thing that is connected one way or another with exchange. If therefore
production is called an exchange of labour and means of production against the
product, it is clear as day that you obtain more exchange-value in proportion
as the production yields more use value. In other words, the more use values,
e.g., stockings, a working day yields to the stocking-manufacturer, the richer
is he in stockings. Suddenly, however, Say recollects that “with a greater
quantity” of stockings their “price” (which of course has nothing to do with
their exchange-value!) falls “parce que la concurrence les (les producteurs)
oblige à donner les produits pour ce qu’ils leur coûtent... <span>[because competition obliges them (the producers) to sell their
products for what they cost to make]</span> But whence does the profit come, if
the capitalist sells the commodities at cost-price? Never mind! Say declares
that, in consequence of increased productivity, every one now receives in
return for a given equivalent two pairs of stockings instead of one as before.
The result he arrives at, is precisely that proposition of Ricardo that he
aimed at disproving. After this mighty effort of thought, he triumphantly
apostrophises Malthus in the words: “Telle est, monsieur, la doctrine bien
liée, sans laquelle il est impossible, je le déclare, d’expliquer les plus
grandes difficultés de l’économie politique, et notamment, comment il se peut
qu’une nation soit plus riche lorsque ses produits diminuent de valeur, quoique
la richesse soit de la valeur.” <span>[This, Sir, is the
well-founded doctrine without which it is impossible, I say, to explain the
greatest difficulties in political economy, and, in particular, to explain why
it is that a nation can be richer when its products fall in value, even though
wealth is value]</span> (l. c., p. 170.) An English economist remarks upon the
conjuring tricks of the same nature that appear in Say’s “Lettres”: “Those
affected ways of talking make up in general that which M. Say is pleased to
call his doctrine and which he earnestly urges Malthus to teach at Hertford, as
it is already taught ‘dans plusieurs parties de l’Europe.’ He says, ‘Si vous
trouvez une physionomie de paradoxe à toutes ces propositions, voyez les choses
qu’elles expriment, et j’ose croire qu’elles vous paraîtront fort simples et
fort raisonnables.’ <span>[in numerous parts of Europe ... If all
those propositions appear paradoxical to you, look at the things they express,
and I venture to believe that they will then appear very simple and very
rational]</span> Doubtless, and in consequence of the same process, they will
appear everything else, except original.” (“An Inquiry into those Principles
Respecting the Nature of Demand, &amp;c.,” pp. 116, 110.)</span></p>

phenomenon. Not even excepting our philosopher, Christian Wolff, in no time and
in no country has the most homespun commonplace ever strutted about in so
self-satisfied a way. The principle of utility was no discovery of Bentham. He
simply reproduced in his dull way what Helvétius and other Frenchmen had said
with esprit in the 18th century. To know what is useful for a dog, one must study
dog-nature. This nature itself is not to be deduced from the principle of
utility. Applying this to man, he that would criticise all human acts,
movements, relations, etc., by the principle of utility, must first deal with
human nature in general, and then with human nature as modified in each
historical epoch. Bentham makes short work of it. With the driest naiveté he
takes the modern shopkeeper, especially the English shopkeeper, as the normal
man. Whatever is useful to this queer normal man, and to his world, is
absolutely useful. This yard-measure, then, he applies to past, present, and
future. The Christian religion, e.g., is “useful,” “because it forbids in the
name of religion the same faults that the penal code condemns in the name of
the law.” Artistic criticism is “harmful,” because it disturbs worthy people in
their enjoyment of Martin Tupper, etc. With such rubbish has the brave fellow,
with his motto, “nuila dies sine line!,” piled up mountains of books. Had I the
courage of my friend, Heinrich Heine, I should call Mr. Jeremy a genius in the

Malthus, whose “Essay on Population” appeared in 1798, I remind him that this
work in its first form is nothing more than a schoolboyish, superficial
plagiary of De Foe, Sir James Steuart, Townsend, Franklin, Wallace, &amp;c.,
and does not contain a single sentence thought out by himself. The great
sensation this pamphlet caused, was due solely to party interest. The French
Revolution had found passionate defenders in the United Kingdom; the “principle
of population,” slowly worked out in the eighteenth century, and then, in the
midst of a great social crisis, proclaimed with drums and trumpets as the
infallible antidote to the teachings of Condorcet, &amp;c., was greeted with
jubilance by the English oligarchy as the great destroyer of all hankerings
after human development. Malthus, hugely astonished at his success, gave
himself to stuffing into his book materials superficially compiled, and adding
to it new matter, not discovered but annexed by him. Note further: Although
Malthus was a parson of the English State Church, he had taken the monastic vow
of celibacy — one of the conditions of holding a Fellowship in Protestant
Cambridge University: “Socios collegiorum maritos esse non permittimus, sed
statim postquam quis uxorem duxerit socius collegii desinat esse.” (“Reports of
Cambridge University Commission,” p. 172.) This circumstance favourably
distinguishes Malthus from the other Protestant parsons, who have shuffled off
the command enjoining celibacy of the priesthood and have taken, “Be fruitful
and multiply,” as their special Biblical mission in such a degree that they
generally contribute to the increase of population to a really unbecoming
extent, whilst they preach at the same time to the labourers the “principle of
population.” It is characteristic that the economic fall of man, the Adam’s
apple, the urgent appetite, “the checks which tend to blunt the shafts of
Cupid,” as Parson Townsend waggishly puts it, that this delicate question was
and is monopolised by the Reverends of Protestant Theology, or rather of the
Protestant Church. With the exception of the Venetian monk, Ortes, an original
and clever writer, most of the population theory teachers are Protestant
parsons. For instance, Bruckner, “Théorie du Système animal,” Leyde, 1767, in
which the whole subject of the modern population theory is exhausted, and to
which the passing quarrel between Quesnay and his pupil, the elder Mirabeau, furnished
ideas on the same topic; then Parson Wallace, Parson Townsend, Parson Malthus
and his pupil, the arch-Parson Thomas Chalmers, to say nothing of lesser
reverend scribblers in this line. Originally, Political Economy was studied by
philosophers like Hobbes, Locke, Hume; by businessmen and statesmen, like
Thomas More, Temple, Sully, De Witt, North, Law, Vanderlint, Cantillon,
Franklin; and especially, and with the greatest success, by medical men like
Petty, Barbon, Mandeville, Quesnay. Even in the middle of the eighteenth
century, the Rev. Mr. Tucker, a notable economist of his time, excused himself
for meddling with the things of Mammon. Later on, and in truth with this very
“Principle of population,” struck the hour of the Protestant parsons. Petty,
who regarded the population as the basis of wealth, and was, like Adam Smith,
an outspoken foe to parsons, says, as if he had a presentiment of their
bungling interference, “that Religion best flourishes when the Priests are most
mortified, as was before said of the Law, which best flourisheth when lawyers
have least to do.” He advises the Protestant priests, therefore, if they, once
for all, will not follow the Apostle Paul and “mortify” themselves by celibacy,
“not to breed more Churchmen than the Benefices, as they now stand shared out,
will receive, that is to say, if there be places for about twelve thousand in
England and Wales, it will not be safe to breed up 24,000 ministers, for then
the twelve thousand which are unprovided for, will seek ways how to get
themselves a livelihood, which they cannot do more easily than by persuading
the people that the twelve thousand incumbents do poison or starve their souls,
and misguide them in their way to Heaven.” (Petty: “A Treatise of Taxes and
Contributions,” London, 1667, p. 57.) Adam Smith’s position with the Protestant
priesthood of his time is shown by the following. In “A Letter to A. Smith,
L.L.D. On the Life, Death, and Philosophy of his Friend, David Hume. By one of
the People called Christians,” 4th Edition, Oxford, 1784, Dr. Horne, Bishop of
Norwich, reproves Adam Smith, because in a published letter to Mr. Strahan, he
“embalmed his friend David” (sc. Hume); because he told the world how “Hume
amused himself on his deathbed with Lucian and Whist,” and because he even had
the impudence to write of Hume: “I have always considered him, both in his
life-time and since his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a
perfectly wise and virtuous man, as, perhaps, the nature of human frailty will
permit.” The bishop cries out, in a passion: “Is it right in you, Sir, to hold
up to our view as ‘perfectly wise and virtuous,’ <em class="calibre4"><span class="calibre48">the</span> character </em><em class="calibre4"><span class="calibre48">and</span> conduct</em> of
one, who seems to have been possessed with an incurable antipathy to all that
is called <em class="calibre4">Religion;</em> and who strained every nerve to explode, suppress
and extirpate the spirit of it among men, that its very name, if he could
effect it, might no more be had in remembrance?” (l. c., p. 8.) “But let not
the lovers of truth be discouraged. Atheism cannot be of long continuance.” (P.
17.) Adam Smith, “had the atrocious wickedness to propagate atheism through the
land (viz., by his “Theory of Moral Sentiments”). Upon the whole, Doctor, your
meaning is good; but I think you will not succeed this time. You would persuade
us, by the example of <em class="calibre4">David Hume, Esq.,</em> that atheism is the only
cordial for low spirits, and the proper antidote against the fear of death....
You may smile over <em class="calibre4">Babylon</em> in ruins and congratulate the hardened <em class="calibre4">Pharaoh</em>
on his overthrow in the Red Sea.” (l. c., pp. 21, 22.) One orthodox individual,
amongst Adam Smith’s college friends, writes after his death: “Smith’s
well-placed affection for Hume ... hindered him from being a Christian.... When
he met with honest men whom he liked ... he would believe almost anything they
said. Had he been a friend of the worthy ingenious Horrox he would have
believed that the moon some times disappeared in a clear sky without the interposition
of a cloud.... He approached to republicanism in his political principles.”
(“The Bee.” By James Anderson, 18 Vols., Vol. 3, pp. 166, 165, Edinburgh,
1791-93.) Parson Thomas Chalmers has his suspicions as to Adam Smith having
invented the category of “unproductive labourers,” solely for the Protestant
parsons, in spite of their blessed work in the vineyard of the Lord.</span></p>

variable capital and its effect on the condition of the class of wage workers
is conjectured rather than understood by some of the prominent economists of the
classical school. The greatest service was rendered here by John Barton,
although he, like all the rest, lumps together constant and fixed capital,
variable and circulating capital. He says: </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“The
demand for labour depends on the increase of circulating, and not of fixed
capital. Were it true that the proportion between these two sorts of capital is
the same at all times, and in all circumstances, then, indeed, it follows that
the number of labourers employed is in proportion to the wealth of the state. But
such a proposition has not the semblance of probability. As arts are
cultivated, and civilisation is extended, fixed capital bears a larger and
larger proportion to circulating capital. The amount of fixed capital employed
in the production of a piece of British muslin is at least a hundred, probably
a thousand times greater than that employed in a similar piece of Indian
muslin. And the proportion of circulating capital is a hundred or thousand
times less ... the whole of the annual savings, added to the fixed capital,
would have no effect in increasing the demand for labour.” (John Barton,
“Observations on the Circumstances which Influence the Condition of the
Labouring Classes of Society.” London, 1817, pp. 16, 17.) “The same cause which
may increase the net revenue of the country may at the same time render the
population redundant, and deteriorate the condition of the labourer.” (Ricardo,
l. c., p. 469.) With increase of capital, “the demand [for labour] will be in a
diminishing ratio.” (Ibid., p. 480, Note.) “The amount of capital devoted to
the maintenance of labour may vary, independently of any changes in the whole
amount of capital.... Great fluctuations in the amount of employment, and great
suffering may become more frequent as capital itself becomes more plentiful.”
(Richard Jones, “An Introductory Lecture on Pol. Econ.,” Lond. 1833, p. 13)
“Demand [for labour] will rise ... not in proportion to the accumulation of the
general capital. ... Every augmentation, therefore, in the national stock destined
for reproduction, comes, in the progress of society, to have less and less
influence upon the condition of the labourer.” (Ramsay, l. c., pp. 90, 91.)</span></p>

we find, in a pamphlet of the operative cotton-spinners of Blackburn, fierce
denunciations of overwork, which, in consequence of the Factory Acts, of course
only affected adult male labourers. “The adult operatives at this mill have
been asked to work from 12 to 13 hours per day, while there are hundreds who
are compelled to be idle who would willingly work partial time, in order to
maintain their families and save their brethren from a premature grave through
being overworked.... We,” it goes on to say, “would ask if the practice of
working overtime by a number of hands, is likely to create a good feeling
between masters and servants. Those who are worked overtime feel the injustice
equally with those who are condemned to forced idleness. There is in the
district almost sufficient work to give to all partial employment if fairly
distributed. We are only asking what is right in requesting the masters
generally to pursue a system of short hours, particularly until a better state
of things begins to dawn upon us, rather than to work a portion of the hands
overtime, while others, for want of work, are compelled to exist upon charity.”
(“Reports of Insp. of Fact., Oct. 31, 1863,” p. 8.) The author of the “Essay on
Trade and Commerce” grasps the effect of a relative surplus population on the
employed labourers with his usual unerring bourgeois instinct. “Another cause
of idleness in this kingdom is the want of a sufficient number of labouring
hands .... Whenever from an extraordinary demand for manufactures, labour grows
scarce, the labourers feel their own consequence, and will make their masters
feel it likewise — it is amazing; but so depraved are the dispositions of these
people, that in such cases a set of workmen have combined to distress the
employer by idling a whole day together.” (“Essay, &amp;c.,” pp. 27, 28.) The

however alters in the borrowing. <em class="calibre4">E.g</em>., when Steuart says: “Here, in

that the wage labourer must always go fasting. He wishes, on the contrary, to
increase their wants and to make the increasing number of their wants a
stimulus to their labour for the “more delicate.”</span></p>

not the slightest means of ventilation except up a hole pulled through the top,

Starving men! The fat oxen from their palace of glass have gone to feed the

in their wretched dens.’ The placards bearing these ominous words are put up at

fresh set is placarded in the former, or some equally public place.... This ...
reminds one of the secret revolutionary associations which prepared the French
people for the events of 1789.... At this moment, while English workmen with

agricultural labourer receives only 1/4 as much milk, and ½ as much bread as
the Irish. Arthur Young in his “Tour in Ireland,” at the beginning of this
century, already noticed the better nourishment of the latter. The reason is
simply this, that the poor Irish farmer is incomparably more humane than the
rich English. As regards Wales, that which is said in the text holds only for
the southwest. All the doctors there agree that the increase of the death-rate
through tuberculosis, scrofula, etc., increases in intensity with the
deterioration of the physical condition of the population, and all ascribe this
deterioration to poverty. “His (the farm labourer’s) keep is reckoned at about
five pence a day, but in many districts it was said to be of much less cost to
the farmer” [himself very poor].... “A morsel of the salt meat or bacon, ...
salted and dried to the texture of mahogany, and hardly worth the difficult
process of assimilation ... is used to flavour a large quantity of broth or
gruel, of meal and leeks, and day after day this is the labourer’s dinner.” The
advance of industry resulted for him, in this harsh and damp climate, in “the
abandonment of the solid homespun clothing in favour of the cheap and so-called
cotton goods,” and of stronger drinks for so-called tea. “The agriculturist,
after several hours’ exposure to wind and rain, pins his cottage to sit by a
fire of peat or of balls of clay and small coal kneaded together, from which
volumes of carbonic and sulphurous acids are poured forth. His walls are of mud
and stones, his floor the bare earth which was there before the hut was built,
his roof a mass of loose and sodden thatch. Every crevice is topped to maintain
warmth, and in an atmosphere of diabolic odour, with a mud floor, with his only
clothes drying on his back, he often sups and sleeps with his wife and
children. Obstetricians who have passed parts of the night in such cabins have
described how they found their feet sinking in the mud of the floor, and they
were forced (easy task) to drill a hole through the wall to effect a little
private respiration. It was attested by numerous witnesses in various grades of
life, that to these insanitary influences, and many more, the underfed peasant
was nightly exposed, and of the result, a debilitated and scrofulous people,
there was no want of evidence.... The statements of the relieving officers of
Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire show in a striking way the same state of
things. There is besides “a plague more horrible still, the great number of
idiots.” Now a word on the climatic conditions. “A strong south-west wind blows
over the whole country for 8 or 9 months in the year, bringing with it torrents
of rain, which discharge principally upon the western slopes of the hills.
Trees are rare, except in sheltered places, and where not protected, are blown
out of all shape. The cottages generally crouch under some bank, or often in a
ravine or quarry, and none but the smallest sheep and native cattle can live on
the pastures.... The young people migrate to the eastern mining districts of
Glamorgan and Monmouth. Carmarthenshire is the breeding ground of the mining
population and their hospital. The population can therefore barely maintain its
numbers.” Thus in Cardiganshire:</span></p>

very nice, but is as unreal as the villages that Catherine II. saw on her
journey to the Crimea. In recent times the shepherd also has often been
banished from these show-villages; <em class="calibre4">e.g</em>., near Market Harboro is
sheep-farm of about 500 acres, which only employs the labour of one man. To
reduce the long trudges over these wide plains, the beautiful pastures of
Leicester and Northampton, the shepherd used to get a cottage on the farm. Now
they give him a thirteenth shilling a week for lodging, that he must find far
away in an open village.</span></p>

villages, which, of course, are always overcrowded) are usually in rows, built
with their backs against the extreme edge of the plot of land which the builder
could call his, and on this account are not allowed light and air, except from
the front.” (Dr. Hunter’s Report, l. c., p. 135.) Very often the beerseller or
grocer of the village is at the same time the letter of its houses. In this
case the agricultural labourer finds in him a second master, besides the
farmer. He must be his customer as well as his tenant. “The hind with his 10s.
a week, minus a rent of £4 a year ... is obliged to buy at the seller’s own
terms, his modicum of tea, sugar, flour, soap, candles, and beer.” (l. c., p.
132.) These open villages form, in fact, the “penal settlements” of the English
agricultural proletariat. Many of the cottages are simply lodging-houses,
through which all the rabble of the neighbourhood passes. The country labourer
and his family who had often, in a way truly wonderful, preserved, under the
foulest conditions, a thoroughness and purity of character, go, in these,
utterly to the devil. It is, of course, the fashion amongst the aristocratic
shylocks to shrug their shoulders pharisaically at the building speculators,
the small landlords, and the open villages. They know well enough that their
“close villages” and “show-villages” are the birth-places of the open villages,
and could not exist without them. “The labourers ... were it not for the small
owners, would, for by far the most part, have to sleep under the trees of the
farms on which they work.” (l. c., p. 135.) The system of “open” and “closed”
villages obtains in all the Midland counties and throughout the East of
England.</span></p>

or indirectly securing to himself the profit on a man employed at 10s. a week,
and receiving from this poor hind £4 or £5 annual rent for houses not worth £20
in a really free market, but maintained at their artificial value by the power
of the owner to say ‘Use my house, or go seek a hiring elsewhere without a
character from me....’ Does a man wish to better himself, to go as a
plate-layer on the railway, or to begin quarry-work, the same power is ready
with ‘Work for me at this low rate of wages or begone at a week’s notice; take
your pig with you, and get what you can for the potatoes growing in your
garden.’ Should his interest appear to be better served by it, an enhanced rent
is sometimes preferred in these cases by the owner (<em class="calibre4">i.e</em>., the farmer)
as the penalty for leaving his service.” (Dr. Hunter, l. c., p. 132.)</span></p>

who had for many years been a detective in the worst quarters of London, says
of the girls of his village: “their boldness and shamelessness I never saw
equalled during some years of police life and detective duty in the worst parts

hind gives dignity even to his position. He is not a slave, but a soldier of
peace, and deserves his place in married men’s quarters to be provided by the
landlord, who has claimed a power of enforced labour similar to that the
country demands of the soldier. He no more receives market-price for his work
than does the soldier. Like the soldier he is caught young, ignorant, knowing
only his own trade, and his own locality. Early marriage and the operation of
the various laws of settlement affect the one as enlistment and the Mutiny Act
affect the other.” (Dr. Hunter, l. c., p. 132.) Sometimes an exceptionally
soft-hearted landlord relents as the solitude he has created. “It is a
melancholy thing to stand alone in one’s country,” said Lord Leicester, when
complimented on the completion of Hookham. “I look around and not a house is to
be seen but mine. I am the giant of Giant Castle, and have eat up all my

the last ten years in France; in proportion as capitalist production there
takes possession of agriculture, it drives the “surplus” agricultural
population into the towns. Here also we find deterioration in the housing and
other conditions at the source of the surplus population. On the special
“prolétariat foncier,” to which this system of parcelling out the land has
given rise, see, among others, the work of Colins, already quoted, and Karl
Marx “Der Achtzehnte Brumaire des Louis Bonaparte.” 2nd edition. Hamburg, 1869,

24.42, the agricultural by 75.58; in 1861, the town by 28.86, the agricultural
by 71.14 per cent. During the last 5 years, the diminution of the agricultural

done by children in gangs used to be done by men and women. More men are out of
work now where children and women are employed than formerly.” (l. c., p. 43,

districts, particularly the arable, is becoming so serious in consequence of
emigration, and the facility afforded by railways for getting to large towns
that I (the “I” is the steward of a great lord) think the services of children
are most indispensable,” (l. c., p. 80, n. 180.) For the “labour question” in
English agricultural districts, differently from the rest of the civilised
world, means the landlords’ and farmers’ question, <em class="calibre4">viz</em>., how is it
possible, despite an always increasing exodus of the agricultural folk, to keep
up a sufficient relative surplus population in the country, and by means of it
keep the wages of the agricultural labourer at a minimum?</span></p>

in dealing with the subject of children’s mortality, the gang-system is treated
in passing, remains unknown to the press, and, therefore, to the English
public. On the other hand, the last report of the “Child. Empl. Comm.” afforded
the press sensational copy always welcome. Whilst the Liberal press asked how
the fine gentlemen and ladies, and the well-paid clergy of the State Church,
with whom Lincolnshire swarms, could allow such a system to arise on their
estates, under their very eyes, they who send out expressly missions to the
Antipodes, “for the improvement of the morals of South Sea Islanders” — the
more refined press confined itself to reflections on the coarse degradation of
the agricultural population who are capable of selling their children into such
slavery! Under the accursed conditions to which these “delicate” people condemn
the agricultural labourer, it would not be surprising if he ate his own
children. What is really wonderful is the healthy integrity of character, he
has, in great part, retained. The official reports prove that the parents, even
in the gang districts, loathe the gang-system. “There is much in the evidence
that shows that the parents of the children would, in many instances, be glad
to be aided by the requirements of a legal obligation, to resist the pressure
and the temptations to which they are often subject. They are liable to be
urged, at times by the parish officers, at times by employers, under threats of
being themselves discharged, to be taken to work at an age when ... school
attendance ... would be manifestly to their greater advantage.... All that time
and strength wasted; all the suffering from extra and unprofitable fatigue
produced to the labourer and to his children; every instance in which the
parent may have traced the moral ruin of his child to the undermining of
delicacy by the over-crowding of cottages, or to the contaminating influences
of the public gang, must have been so many incentives to feelings in the minds
of the labouring poor which can be well understood, and which it would be
needless to particularise. They must be conscious that much bodily and mental
pain has thus been inflicted upon them from causes for which they were in no
way answerable; to which, had it been in their power, they would have in no way
consented; and against which they were powerless to struggle.” (l. c., p. xx.,
§ 82, and xxiii., n. 96.)</span></p>

have been deliberately made the most of, both by the individual landlords and
by the English legislature, to forcibly carry out the agricultural revolution
and to thin the population of Ireland down to the proportion satisfactory to
the landlords, I shall show more fully in Vol. III. of this work, in the
section on landed property. There also I return to the condition of the small
farmers and the agricultural labourers. At present, only one quotation. Nassau
W. Senior says, with other things, in his posthumous work, “Journals,
Conversations and Essays relating to Ireland.” 2 vols. London, 1868; Vol. II.,
p. 282. “Well,” said Dr. G., “we have got our Poor Law and it is a great
instrument for giving the victory to the landlords. Another, and a still more
powerful instrument is emigration.... No friend to Ireland can wish the war to be
prolonged [between the landlords and the small Celtic farmers] — still less,
that it should end by the victory of the tenants. The sooner it is over — the
sooner Ireland becomes a grazing country, with the comparatively thin
population which a grazing country requires, the better for all classes.” The
English Corn Laws of 1815 secured Ireland the monopoly of the free importation
of corn into Great Britain. They favoured artificially, therefore, the
cultivation of corn. With the abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846, this monopoly
was suddenly removed. Apart from all other circumstances, this event alone was
sufficient to give a great impulse to the turning of Irish arable into pasture
land, to the concentration of farms, and to the eviction of small cultivators.
After the fruitfulness of the Irish soil had been praised from 1815 to 1846,
and proclaimed loudly as by Nature herself destined for the cultivation of
wheat, English agronomists, economists, politicians, discover suddenly that it
is good for nothing but to produce forage. M. Léonce de Lavergne has hastened
to repeat this on the other side of the Channel. It takes a “serious” man, à la
Lavergne, to be caught by such childishness.</span></p>

transformed him into a free proletarian, who, moreover, found his master ready
waiting for him in the towns, for the most part handed down as legacies from
the Roman time. When the revolution of the world-market, about the end of the
15th century, annihilated Northern Italy’s commercial supremacy, a movement in
the reverse direction set in. The labourers of the towns were driven <em class="calibre4">en

great part of the lands of the kingdom unto the hold and occupation of the
yeomanry or middle people, of a condition between gentlemen, and cottagers and
peasants.... For it hath been held by the general opinion of men of best
judgment in the wars.... that the principal strength of an army consisteth in
the infantry or foot. And to make good infantry it requireth men bred, not in a
servile or indigent fashion, but in some free and plentiful manner. Therefore,
if a state run most to noblemen and gentlemen, and that the husbandman and
ploughmen be but as their workfolk and labourers, or else mere cottagers (which
are but hous’d beggars), you may have a good cavalry, but never good stable
bands of foot.... And this is to be seen in France, and Italy, and some other

be seen from the following, among other things. In the south of England certain
landed proprietors and well-to-do farmers put their heads together and
propounded ten questions as to the right interpretation of the poor-law of
Elizabeth. These they laid before a celebrated jurist of that time, Sergeant
Snigge (later a judge under James I.) for his opinion. “Question 9 — Some of
the more wealthy farmers in the parish have devised a skilful mode by which all
the trouble of executing this Act (the 43rd of Elizabeth) might be avoided.
They have proposed that we shall erect a prison in the parish, and then give
notice to the neighbourhood, that if any persons are disposed to farm the poor
of this parish, they do give in sealed proposals, on a certain day, of the
lowest price at which they will take them off our hands; and that they will be
authorised to refuse to any one unless he be shut up in the aforesaid prison.
The proposers of this plan conceive that there will be found in the adjoining
counties, persons, who, being unwilling to labour and not possessing substance
or credit to take a farm or ship, so as to live without labour, may be induced
to make a very advantageous offer to the parish. If any of the poor perish
under the contractor’s care, the sin will lie at his door, as the parish will
have done its duty by them. We are, however, apprehensive that the present Act
(43rd of Elizabeth) will not warrant a prudential measure of this kind; but you
are to learn that the rest of the freeholders of the county, and of the
adjoining county of B, will very readily join in instructing their members to
propose an Act to enable the parish to contract with a person to lock up and
work the poor; and to declare that if any person shall refuse to be so locked
up and worked, he shall be entitled to no relief. This, it is hoped, will
prevent persons in distress from wanting relief, and be the means of keeping
down parishes.” (R. Blakey: “The History of Political Literature from the
Earliest Times.” Lond., 1855, Vol. II., pp. 84-85.) In Scotland, the abolition
of serfdom took place some centuries later than in England. Even in 1698,
Fletcher of Saltoun, declared in the Scotch parliament, “The number of beggars
in Scotland is reckoned at not less than 200,000. The only remedy that I, a
republican on principle, can suggest, is to restore the old state of serfdom,
to make slaves of all those who are unable to provide for their own
subsistence.” Eden, l. c., Book I., ch. 1, pp. 60-61, says, “The decrease of
villenage seems necessarily to have been the era of the origin of the poor.
Manufactures and commerce are the two parents of our national poor.” Eden, like
our Scotch republican on principle, errs only in this: not the abolition of
villenage, but the abolition of the property of the agricultural labourer in
the soil made him a proletarian, and eventually a pauper. In France, where the
expropriation was effected in another way, the ordonnance of Moulins, 1571, and
the Edict of 1656, correspond to the English poor-laws.</span></p>

reminded of ancient Rome. “The rich had got possession of the greater part of
the undivided land. They trusted in the conditions of the time, that these
possessions would not be again taken from them, and bought, therefore, some of
the pieces of land lying near theirs, and belonging to the poor, with the
acquiescence of their owners, and took some by force, so that they now were
cultivating widely extended domains, instead of isolated fields. Then they
employed slaves in agriculture and cattle-breeding, because freemen would have been
taken from labour for military service. The possession of slaves brought them
great gain, inasmuch as these, on account of their immunity from military
service, could freely multiply and have a multitude of children. Thus the
powerful men drew all wealth to themselves, and all the land swarmed with
slaves. The Italians, on the other hand, were always decreasing in number,
destroyed as they were by poverty, taxes, and military service. Even when times
of peace came, they were doomed to complete inactivity, because the rich were
in possession of the soil, and used slaves instead of freemen in the tilling of
it.” (Appian: “Civil Wars,” I.7.) This passage refers to the time before the
Licinian rogations. Military service, which hastened to so great an extent the
ruin of the Roman plebeians, was also the chief means by which, as in a
forcing-house, Charlemagne brought about the transformation of free German
peasants into serfs and bondsmen.</span></p>

says Buchanan, the commentator on Adam Smith, 1814, “the ancient state of
property is daily subverted.... The landlord, without regard to the hereditary
tenant (a category used in error here), now offers his land to the highest
bidder, who, if he is an improver, instantly adopts a new system of
cultivation. The land, formerly overspread with small tenants or labourers, was
peopled in proportion to its produce, but under the new system of improved
cultivation and increased rents, the largest possible produce is obtained at
the least possible expense: and the useless hands being, with this view,
removed, the population is reduced, not to what the land will maintain, but to
what it will employ. “The dispossessed tenants either seek a subsistence in the
neighbouring towns,” &amp;c. (David Buchanan: “Observations on, &amp;c., A.
Smith’s Wealth of Nations.” Edinburgh, 1814, vol. iv., p. 144.) “The Scotch
grandees dispossessed families as they would grub up coppice-wood, and they
treated villages and their people as Indians harassed with wild beasts do, in
their vengeance, a jungle with tigers.... Man is bartered for a fleece or a
carcase of mutton, nay, held cheaper.... Why, how much worse is it than the
intention of the Moguls, who, when they had broken into the northern provinces
of China, proposed in council to exterminate the inhabitants, and convert the
land into pasture. This proposal many Highland proprietors have effected in

letters originally appeared in <em class="calibre4">The Times</em>. The English economists of
course explained the famine of the Gaels in 1847, by their over-population. At
all events, they “were pressing on their food-supply.” The “clearing of
estates,” or as it is called in Germany, “Bauernlegen,” occurred in Germany
especially after the 30 years’ war, and led to peasant-revolts as late as 1790
in Kursachsen. It obtained especially in East Germany. In most of the Prussian
provinces, Frederick II. for the first time secured right of property for the
peasants. After the conquest of Silesia he forced the landlords to rebuild the
huts, barns, etc., and to provide the peasants with cattle and implements. He
wanted soldiers for his army and tax-payers for his treasury. For the rest, the
pleasant life that the peasant led under Frederick’s system of finance and
hodge-podge rule of despotism, bureaucracy and feudalism, may be seen from the
following quotation from his admirer, Mirabeau: “Le lin fait donc une des
grandes richesses du cultivateur dans le Nord de l’Allemagne. Malheureusement
pour l’espèce humaine, ce n’est qu’une ressource contre la misère et non un
moyen de bien-être. Les impôts directs, les corvées, les servitudes de tout
genre, écrasent le cultivateur allemand, qui paie encore des impôts indirects
dans tout ce qu’il achète.... et pour comble de ruine, il n’ose pas vendre ses
productions où et comme il le veut; il n’ose pas acheter ce dont il a besoin
aux marchands qui pourraient le lui livrer au meilleur prix. Toutes ces causes
le ruinent insensiblement, et il se trouverait hors d’état de payer les impôts
directs à l’échéance sans la filerie; elle lui offre une ressource, en occupant
utilement sa femme, ses enfants, ses servants, ses valets, et lui-même; mais
quelle pénible vie, même aidée de ce secours. En été, il travaille comme un
forçat au labourage et à la récolte; il se couche à 9 heures et se lève à deux,
pour suffire aux travaux; en hiver il devrait réparer ses forces par un plus
grand repos; mais il manquera de grains pour le pain et les semailles, s’il se
défait des denrées qu’il faudrait vendre pour payer les impôts. Il faut donc
filer pour suppléer à ce vide.... il faut y apporter la plus grande assiduité.
Aussi le paysan se couche-t-il en hiver à minuit, une heure, et se lève à cinq
ou six; ou bien il se couche à neuf, et se lève à deux, et cela tous les jours
de la vie si ce n’est le dimanche. Ces excès de veille et de travail usent la
nature humaine, et de là vient qu’hommes et femmes vieillissent beaucoup plutôt
dans les campagnes que dans les villes.” <span>[Flax represents
one of the greatest sources of wealth for the peasant of North Germany. Unfortunately
for the human race, this is only a resource against misery and not a means
towards well-being. Direct taxes, forced labour service, obligations of all
kinds crush the German peasant, especially as he still has to pay indirect
taxes on everything he buys, ... and to complete his ruin he dare not sell his
produce where and as he wishes; he dare not buy what he needs from the
merhcants who could sell it to him at a cheaper price. He is slowly ruined by
all those factors, and when the dirct taxes fall due, he would find himself
incapable of paying them without his spinning-wheel; it offers him a last
resort, while providing useful occupation for his wife, his children, his
maids, his farm-hands, and himself; but what a painful life he leads, even with
this extra resource! In summer, he works like a convict with the plough and at
harvest; he goes to bed at nine o’clock and rises at two to get through all his
work; in winter he ought to be recovering his strength by sleeping longer; but
he would run short of corn for his bread and next year’s sowing if he got rid
of the products that he needs to sell in order to pay the taxes. He therefore
has to spin to fill up this gap ... and indeed he must do so most assiduously.
Thus the peasant goes to bed at midnight or one o’clock in winter, and gets up
at five or six; or he goes to bed at nine and gets up at two, and this he does
every day of his life except Sundays. These excessively short hours of sleep
and long hours of work consume a person’s strength and hence it happens that
men and women age much more in the country than in the towns]</span> (Mirabeau,

<p class="MsoNormal"><em class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-GB">Note
to the second edition.</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> In April 1866, 18 years after the publication of the work of Robert
Somers quoted above, Professor Leone Levi gave a lecture before the Society of
Arts on the transformation of sheep-walks into deer-forest, in which he depicts
the advance in the devastation of the Scottish Highlands. He says, with other
things: “Depopulation and transformation into sheep-walks were the most
convenient means for getting an income without expenditure... A deer-forest in
place of a sheep-walk was a common change in the Highlands. The landowners
turned out the sheep as they once turned out the men from their estates, and
welcomed the new tenants — the wild beasts and the feathered birds.... One can
walk from the Earl of Dalhousie’s estates in Forfarshire to John O’Groats,
without ever leaving forest land.... In many of these woods the fox, the wild
cat, the marten, the polecat, the weasel and the Alpine hare are common; whilst
the rabbit, the squirrel and the rat have lately made their way into the
country. Immense tracts of land, much of which is described in the statistical
account of Scotland as having a pasturage in richness and extent of very
superior description, are thus shut out from all cultivation and improvement,
and are solely devoted to the sport of a few persons for a very brief period of
the year.” The London <em class="calibre4">Economist</em> of June 2, 1866, says, “Amongst the
items of news in a Scotch paper of last week, we read... ’One of the finest
sheep farms in Sutherlandshire, for which a rent of £1,200 a year was recently
offered, on the expiry of the existing lease this year, is to be converted into
a deer-forest.’ Here we see the modern instincts of feudalism ... operating
pretty much as they did when the Norman Conqueror... destroyed 36 villages to
create the New Forest.... Two millions of acres... totally laid waste,
embracing within their area some of the most fertile lands of Scotland. The
natural grass of Glen Tilt was among the most nutritive in the county of Perth.
The deer-forest of Ben Aulder was by far the best grazing ground in the wide
district of Badenoch; a part of the Black Mount forest was the best pasture for
black-faced sheep in Scotland. Some idea of the ground laid waste for purely

“Utopia": “Therfore that on covetous and unsatiable cormaraunte and very
plage of his native contrey maye compasse aboute and inclose many thousand
akers of grounde together within one pale or hedge, the husbandman be thrust
owte of their owne, or els either by coneyne and fraude, or by violent
oppression they be put besydes it, or by wrongs and iniuries thei be so weried
that they be compelled to sell all: by one meanes, therfore, or by other,
either by hooke or crooke they muste needes departe awaye, poore, selye,
wretched soules, men, women, husbands, wiues, fatherlesse children, widowes,
wofull mothers with their yonge babes, and their whole household smal in
substance, and muche in numbre, as husbandrye requireth many handes. Awaye thei
trudge, I say, owte of their knowen accustomed houses, fyndynge no place to
reste in. All their housholde stuffe, which is very little woorthe, thoughe it
might well abide the sale: yet beeynge sodainely thruste owte, they be
constrayned to sell it for a thing of nought. And when they haue wandered
abrode tyll that be spent, what cant they then els doe but steale, and then
iustly pardy be hanged, or els go about beggyng. And yet then also they be
caste in prison as vagaboundes, because they go aboute and worke not: whom no
man wyl set a worke though thei neuer so willyngly profre themselues therto.”
Of these poor fugitives of whom Thomas More says that they were forced to
thieve, “7,200 great and petty thieves were put to death,” in the reign of
Henry VIII. (Holinshed, “Description of England,” Vol. 1, p. 186.) In
Elizabeth’s time, “rogues were trussed up apace, and that there was not one
year commonly wherein three or four hundred were not devoured and eaten up by
the gallowes.” (Strype’s “Annals of the Reformation and Establishment of
Religion and other Various Occurrences in the Church of England during Queen
Elizabeth’s Happy Reign.” Second ed., 1725, Vol. 2.) According to this same
Strype, in Somersetshire, in one year, 40 persons were executed, 35 robbers
burnt in the hand, 37 whipped, and 183 discharged as “incorrigible vagabonds.”
Nevertheless, he is of opinion that this large number of prisoners does not
comprise even a fifth of the actual criminals, thanks to the negligence of the
justices and the foolish compassion of the people; and the other counties of
England were not better off in this respect than Somersetshire, while some were
even worse.</span></p>

I., c. 6, we see that certain clothmakers took upon themselves to dictate, in
their capacity of justices of the peace, the official tariff of wages in their
own shops. In Germany, especially after the Thirty Years’ War, statutes for
keeping down wages were general. “The want of servants and labourers was very
troublesome to the landed proprietors in the depopulated districts. All
villagers were forbidden to let rooms to single men and women; all the latter were
to be reported to the authorities and cast into prison if they were unwilling
to become servants, even if they were employed at any other work, such as
sowing seeds for the peasants at a daily wage, or even buying and selling corn.
(Imperial privileges and sanctions for Silesia, I., 25.) For a whole century in
the decrees of the small German potentates a bitter cry goes up again and again
about the wicked and impertinent rabble that will not reconcile itself to its
hard lot, will not be content with the legal wage; the individual landed
proprietors are forbidden to pay more than the State had fixed by a tariff. And
yet the conditions of service were at times better after war than 100 years
later; the farm servants of Silesia had, in 1652, meat twice a week, whilst
even in our century, districts are known where they have it only three times a
year. Further, wages after the war were higher than in the following century.”

things are dearer than they were, so much do you arise in the pryce of your

we might advance ye price there of, to countervaile those things that we must
buy agayne.” In another place, the knight asks the doctor: “I pray you, what be
those sorts that ye meane. And first, of those that ye thinke should have no
losse thereby? <em class="calibre4">Doctor</em>: I mean all those that live by buying and
selling, for as they buy deare, they sell thereafter. <em class="calibre4">Knight</em>: What is

What sorte is that which, ye sayde should have greater losse hereby, than these
men had profit? <em class="calibre4">Doctor</em>: It is all noblemen, gentlemen, and all other

collector of dues for the feudal lords during the earlier part of the middle
ages, soon became an homme d'affaires, who by extortion, cheating, &amp;c.,
swindled himself into a capitalist. These régisseurs themselves were sometimes
noblemen. <em class="calibre4">E.g.</em>, “C'est li compte que messire Jacques de Thoraine, chevalier
chastelain sor Besançon rent és-seigneur tenant les comptes à Dijon pour
monseigneur le duc et comte de Bourgoigne, des rentes appartenant à la dite
chastellenie, depuis xxve jour de décembre MCCCLIX jusqu'au xxviiie jour de
décembre MCCCLX.” <span>[This is the account given by M. Jacques
de Thoraisse, knight, and Lord of a manor near Besançon, to the lord who
administers the accounts at Dijon for his highness the Duke and Count of
Burgundy, of the rents appurtenant to the above-mentioned manor, from the 25th
day of December 1359 to the 28th day of December 1360]</span> (Alexis Monteil:
“Traité de Matériaux Manuscrits etc.,” pp. 234, 235.) Already it is evident
here how in all spheres of social life the lion's share falls to the middleman.
In the economic domain, <em class="calibre4">e.g</em>., financiers, stock-exchange speculators,
merchants, shopkeepers skim the cream; in civil matters, the lawyer fleeces his
clients; in politics the representative is of more importance than the voters,
the minister than the sovereign; in religion, God is pushed into the background
by the “Mediator,” and the latter again is shoved back by the priests, the
inevitable middlemen between the good shepherd and his sheep. In France, as in
England, the great feudal territories were divided into innumerable small
homesteads, but under conditions incomparably more favorable for the people.
During the 14th century arose the farms or <em class="calibre4">terriers</em>. Their number grew
constantly, far beyond 100,000. They paid rents varying from 1/12 to 1/5 of the
product in money or in kind. These farms were fiefs, sub-fiefs, &amp;c.,
according the value and extent of the domains, many of them only containing a
few acres. But these farmers had rights of jurisdiction in some degree over the
dwellers on the soil; there were four grades. The oppression of the
agricultural population under all these petty tyrants will be understood.
Monteil says that there were once in France 160,000 judges, where today, 4,000
tribunals, including justices of the peace, suffice. </span></p>

found in English legislation from the moment when the class of wage labourers
becomes noticeable. This term is used in opposition, on the one hand, to the
“idle poor,” beggars, etc., on the. out and out vulgar bourgeois. “The laws of
commerce are the laws of Nature, and therefore the laws of God.” (E. Burke, l.
c., pp. 31, 32.) No wonder that, true to the laws of God and of Nature, he
always sold himself in the best market. A very good portrait of this Edmund Burke,
during his liberal time, is to be found in the writings of the Rev. Mr. Tucker.
Tucker was a parson and a Tory, but, for the rest, an honourable man and a
competent political economist. In face of the infamous cowardice of character
that reigns today, and believes most devoutly in “the laws of commerce,” it is
our bounden duty again and again to brand the Burkes, who only differ from
their successors in one thing — talent.</span></p>

Reviewer to fly turbulence and strife, and to be timid, which is very true; but
this is very incompletely stating the question. Capital eschews no profit, or
very small profit, just as Nature was formerly said to abhor a vacuum. With
adequate profit, capital is very bold. A certain 10 per cent. will ensure its
employment anywhere; 20 per cent. certain will produce eagerness; 50 per cent.,
positive audacity; 100 per cent. will make it ready to trample on all human
laws; 300 per cent., and there is not a crime at which it will scruple, nor a
risk it will not run, even to the chance of its owner being hanged. If
turbulence and strife will bring a profit, it will freely encourage both.
Smuggling and the slave-trade have amply proved all that is here stated.” (T.

advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces
the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by their revolutionary combination,
due to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from
under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and
appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all,
are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are
equally inevitable.... Of all the classes that stand face-to-face with the
bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The
other classes perish and disappear in the face of Modern Industry, the
proletariat is its special and essential product.... The lower middle classes,
the small manufacturers, the shopkeepers, the artisan, the peasant, all these
fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions
of the middle class... they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the
wheel of history. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, “Manifest der Kommunistischen

passim. Even the mild, Free Trade, vulgar economist, Molinari, says: “Dans les
colonies où l’esclavage a été aboli sans que le travail forcé se trouvait
remplacé par une quantité équivalente de travail libre, on a vu s’opérer la
contre-partie du fait qui se réalise tous les jours sous nos yeux. On a vu les
simples travailleurs exploiter à leur tour les entrepreneurs d’industrie,
exiger d’eux des salaires hors de toute proportion avec la part légitime qui
leur revenait dans le produit. Les planteurs, ne pouvant obtenir de leurs
sucres un prix suffisant pour couvrir la hausse de salaire, ont été obligés de
fournir l’excédant, d’abord sur leurs profits, ensuite sur leurs capitaux
mêmes. Une foule de planteurs ont été ruinés de la sorte, d’autres ont fermé
leurs ateliers pour échapper à une ruine imminente.... Sans doute, il vaut
mieux voir périr des accumulations de capitaux que des générations d’hommes
[how generous Mr. Molinari!]: mais ne vaudrait-il pas mieux que ni les uns ni
les autres périssent? <span>[In the colonies where slavery has
been abolished without the compulsory labour being replaced with an equivalent
quantity of free labour, there has occurred the opposite of what happens every
day before our eyes. Simple workers have been seen to exploit in their turn the
industrial entrepreneurs, demanding from them wages which bear absolutely no
relation to the legitimate share in the product which they ought to receive.
The planters were unable to obtain for their sugar for a sufficent price to
cover the increase in wages, and were obliged to furnish the extra amount, at
first out of their profits, and then out of their very capital. A considerable
amount of planters have been ruined as a result, while others have closed down
their businesses in order to avoid the ruin which threatened them ... It is
doubtless better that these accumulations of capital should be destroyed than
that generations of men should perish ... but would it not be better if both
survived?]</span> (Molinari, l.c., pp.51,52.) Mr. Molinari, Mr. Molinari! What
then becomes of the ten commandments, of Moses and the prophets, of the law of
supply and demand, if in Europe the “entrepreneur” can cut down the labourer’s
legitimate part, and in the West Indies, the labourer can cut down the
entrepreneur’s? And what, if you please, is this “legitimate part,” which on
your own showing the capitalist in Europe daily neglects to pay? Over yonder,
in the colonies where the labourers are so “simple” as to “exploit” the
capitalist, Mr. Molinari feels a strong itching to set the law of supply and
demand, that works elsewhere automatically, on the right road by means of the
police.</span></p>
